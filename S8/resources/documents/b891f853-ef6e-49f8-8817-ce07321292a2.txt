In this tutorial, we'll explore knowledge graphs and how they can be used to build RAG

applications for more accurate and relevant responses.

We’ll start by breaking down the basics of knowledge graphs and their role in RAG. We’ll

compare these to vector databases and learn when it's best to use one or the other. Then,

we’ll get hands-on to create a knowledge graph from text data, store it in a database, and

use it to find relevant info for user queries. We’ll also look at expanding this approach to

handle different types of data and file formats beyond just plain text.

## **What Is a Knowledge Graph?**

Knowledge graphs represent information in a structured, interconnected format. They
consist of entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) between those entities. Entities can

represent real-world objects, concepts, or ideas, while relationships describe how those

entities are connected.

The intuition behind knowledge graphs is to mimic the way humans understand and reason

about the world. We don't store information in isolated silos; instead, we make connections

between different pieces of information, forming a rich, interconnected web of knowledge.

Knowledge graphs help us see how entities are connected by clearly showing the

relationships between different entities. Exploring these connections allows us to find new

information and make conclusions that would be hard to draw from separate pieces of

information.

Let’s look at an example.

**Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {"error":"model \"llama3\" not found, try pulling it first"}

Figure 1: In this visual representation, the nodes are shown as circles, and the relationships

are represented as labeled arrows connecting the nodes.

This knowledge graph effectively captures the employment relationships between the

individuals Sarah and Michael and the company prismaticAI. In our example, we have three

nodes:

**Node** **1**

Type: Person

Name: Sarah

**Node 2**

Type: Person

Name: Michael

**Node 3**

Type: Company

Name: prismaticAI

In sum, we have two person nodes (Sarah and Michael) and one company node
(prismaticAI). Now, let's look at the relationships (edges) between these nodes:

**Relationship 1** : Sarah --[works for]--> prismaticAI

This relationship indicates that Sarah, represented by Node 1, has a "works for"

relationship with prismaticAI, represented by Node 3. In other words, Sarah is an

employee of prismaticAI.

**Relationship 2** : Michael --[works for]--> prismaticAI

Similar to the first relationship, this one shows that Michael, represented by Node 2,
also has a "works for" relationship with prismaticAI (Node 3). Michael is an

employee of prismaticAI as well.

**Querying and traversing knowledge graphs**

One of the powerful aspects of knowledge graphs is the ability to query and traverse the

relationships between entities to extract relevant information or infer new knowledge. Let's

explore how we can do this with our example knowledge graph.

First, we need to determine what information we want to retrieve from the knowledge graph.

For example:

https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 2/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp

**Query 1** : Where does Sarah work?

To answer the query, we need to find the appropriate starting point in the knowledge graph.

In this case, we want to start from the node representing Sarah.

From the starting point (Sarah's node), we follow the outgoing "works for" relationship edge.

This edge connects Sarah's node to the node representing prismaticAI. By traversing the

"works for" relationship, we can conclude that Sarah works for prismaticAI.

**Answer 1:** Sarah works for prismaticAI.

Let's try another query:

**Query 2** : Who works for prismaticAI?

This time, we want to start from the node representing prismaticAI.

From the prismaticAI node, we follow the "works for" relationship edges backward. This will

lead us to the nodes representing the people who work for prismaticAI. By traversing the

"works for" relationships in reverse, we can identify that both Sarah and Michael work for

prismaticAI.

**Answer 2** : Sarah and Michael work for prismaticAI.

One more example!

**Query 3** : Does Michael work for the same company as Sarah?

We can start from either Sarah's node or Michael's node. Let's start from Sarah's node.

We follow the "works for" relationship to reach the prismaticAI node.

Then, we check if Michael also has a "works for" relationship leading to the same

prismaticAI node. Since both Sarah and Michael have a "works for" relationship with the

prismaticAI node, we can conclude that they work for the same company.

**Answer 3** : Yes, Michael works for the same company as Sarah (prismaticAI).

Traversing the relationships in the knowledge graph allows us to extract specific pieces of

information and understand the connections between entities. Knowledge graphs can

become much more complex, with numerous nodes and relationships, allowing for the

representation of intricate real-world knowledge in a structured and interconnected way.
## **Benefits of Knowledge Graphs in RAG Applications**

RAG applications combine information retrieval and natural language generation to provide

relevant and coherent responses to user queries or prompts. Knowledge graphs offer several

advantages that make them particularly well-suited for these applications. Let's dive into the

key benefits:

**Structured knowledge representation**

As we learned in the previous section, knowledge graphs represent information in a
structured manner, with entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). This structured

representation makes it easier to retrieve relevant information for a given query or task,

compared to unstructured text data.

In our example knowledge graph, we can easily retrieve information about who works for

prismaticAI by following the "works for" relationships.

**Contextual understanding**

Knowledge graphs capture the relationships between entities, enabling a deeper

understanding of the context in which information is presented. This contextual

understanding is crucial for generating coherent and relevant responses in RAG

applications.

Back to our example, understanding the "works for" relationship between Sarah, Michael,

and prismaticAI, would allow a RAG application to provide more contextually relevant

responses about their employment.

**Inferential reasoning**

Traversing the relationships in a knowledge graph allows RAG applications to make

inferences and derive new knowledge that may not be explicitly stated. This inferential

https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 3/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp

reasoning capability improves the quality and completeness of the generated responses.

By traversing the relationships, a RAG application can infer that Sarah and Michael work for

the same company, even if this information is not directly stated.

**Knowledge integration**

Knowledge graphs can integrate information from multiple sources, allowing RAG

applications to use diverse and complementary knowledge bases. This integration of

knowledge can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded responses.

We could add information about companies, employees, and their roles from various sources

to our knowledge graph example, providing a more complete picture for generating

responses.

**Explainability and transparency**

Knowledge graphs provide a transparent representation of the knowledge used in

generating responses. This transparency is key for explaining the reasoning behind the

generated output, which is important in many applications, such as question-answering

systems.

The explanation for answer 3 in our example could be: Yes, Michael works for the same

company as Sarah. I arrived at this conclusion by identifying that Sarah works for

prismaticAI and then verifying that Michael also has a 'works for' relationship with

prismaticAI. Since they both have this relationship with the same company entity, I can infer

that they work for the same company.

This transparency in the reasoning process allows users and developers to understand how

the RAG application arrived at its response rather than treating it as a black box. It also

increases trust in the system, as the decision-making process is clearly laid out and can be

verified against the knowledge graph.

Also, if there are any inconsistencies or missing information in the knowledge graph, the

explanation can help identify and address those issues, leading to improved accuracy and

completeness of the responses.

Using knowledge graphs, RAG applications can create more accurate, clear, and

understandable responses. This makes them useful for different tasks in natural language

processing.
## **Knowledge Graphs Vs. Vector Databases**

When building RAG applications, you may encounter two different approaches: knowledge

graphs and vector databases. While both are used for representing and retrieving

information, they differ in their underlying data structures and the way they handle

information.

Let's explore the key differences between these two approaches:


**Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {"error":"model \"llama3\" not found, try pulling it first"}

**Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {"error":"model \"llama3\" not found, try pulling it first"}





Both knowledge graphs and vector databases have their strengths and use cases, and the

choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application. Knowledge

graphs excel at representing and reasoning over structured knowledge, while vector

databases are well-suited for tasks that rely heavily on semantic similarity and information

retrieval based on vector representations.

You can learn more about vector databases in this **[introduction to vector databases for](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-vector-databases-for-machine-learning)**

**[machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-vector-databases-for-machine-learning)** . Additionally, see the **[five most popular vector databases](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/the-top-5-vector-databases)** .
## **How to Implement Knowledge Graphs for RAG** **Applications**

In this section, we'll explore how to implement a knowledge graph to augment the language
generation process for RAG application.

We'll cover the following key steps:

Loading and preprocessing text data.

Initializing a language model and extracting a knowledge graph.

Storing the knowledge graph in a database for persistence and querying.

Retrieving relevant knowledge from the graph based on user queries.

Generating responses by synthesizing the retrieved knowledge with the language

model.

By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of implementing knowledge

graphs in RAG applications, enabling you to build more intelligent and context-aware

language generation systems.

**Prerequisites**

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher

LangChain library ( `pip install langchain` )

LlamaIndex library ( `pip install llama-index` )

Neo4j database (or any other compatible graph database)

**Step 1: Load and preprocess text data**

The first step is to load and preprocess the text data from which we'll extract the knowledge

graph. In this example, we'll use a text snippet describing a technology company called

https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 5/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp

prismaticAI, its employees, and their roles.
```
               from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
               from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
               # Load text data
               text = """Sarah is an employee at prismaticAI, a leading technology company based
               Michael is also an employee at prismaticAI, where he works as a data scientist. H
               prismaticAI is a well-known technology company that specializes in developing cut
               Both Sarah and Michael are highly skilled professionals who contribute significan
               loader = TextLoader(text)
               documents = loader.load()
               text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=20)
               texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

```
**[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)**

We start by importing the necessary classes from LangChain: TextLoader and

CharacterTextSplitter . TextLoader loads the text data, while CharacterTextSplitter splits

the text into smaller chunks for more efficient processing.

Next, we define the text data as a multi-line string variable text .

We then use TextLoader to load the text data directly from the text variable. The

loader.load() method returns a list of Document objects, each containing a chunk of the

text.

To split the text into smaller, more manageable chunks, we create an instance of

CharacterTextSplitter with a chunk_size of 200 characters and a chunk_overlap of 20

characters. The chunk_overlap parameter ensures that there is some overlap between

adjacent chunks, which can be helpful for maintaining context during the knowledge

extraction process.

Finally, we use the split_documents method of CharacterTextSplitter to split the

Document objects into smaller chunks, which are stored in the texts variable as a list of

Document objects.

Preprocessing the text data in this way allows us to prepare it for the next step, where we'll

initialize a language model and use it to extract a knowledge graph from the text chunks.

**Step 2: Initialize language model and extract knowledge graph**

After loading and preprocessing the text data, the next step is to initialize a language model

and use it to extract a knowledge graph from the text chunks. In this example, we'll be using

the OpenAI language model provided by LangChain.
```
               from langchain.llms import OpenAI
               from langchain.transformers import LLMGraphTransformer
               import getpass
               import os
               # Load environment variable for OpenAI API key
               os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
               # Initialize LLM
               llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
               # Extract Knowledge Graph
               llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm)
               graph_documents = llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(texts)

```
**[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)**

First, we import the necessary classes from LangChain: OpenAI and

LLMGraphTransformer . OpenAI is a wrapper for the OpenAI language model, which we'll

use to extract the knowledge graph. LLMGraphTransformer is a utility class that helps

convert text data into a knowledge graph representation.

https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 6/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp

Next, we load the OpenAI API key from an environment variable. This is a security best

practice to avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials in your code.

We then initialize an instance of the OpenAI language model with a temperature of 0 . The

temperature parameter controls the randomness of the model's output, with lower values

producing more deterministic responses.

After initializing the language model, we create an instance of LLMGraphTransformer and

pass the initialized llm object to it. The LLMGraphTransformer class converts the text
chunks ( texts ) into a knowledge graph representation.

Finally, we call the convert_to_graph_documents method of LLMGraphTransformer,

passing in the texts list. This method uses the language model to analyze the text chunks

and extract relevant entities, relationships, and other structured information, which are then

represented as a knowledge graph. The resulting knowledge graph is stored in the

graph_documents variable.

We have successfully initialized a language model and used it to extract a knowledge graph

from the text data. In the next step, we’ll store the knowledge graph in a database for

persistence and querying.

**Step 3: Store knowledge graph in a database**

After extracting the knowledge graph from the text data, it's important to store it in a

persistent and queryable format. In this tutorial, we'll use Neo4j to store the knowledge
graph.
```
               from langchain.graph_stores import Neo4jGraphStore
               # Store Knowledge Graph in Neo4j
               graph_store = Neo4jGraphStore(url="neo4j://your_neo4j_url", username="your_userna
               graph_store.write_graph(graph_documents)

```
**[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)**

First, we import the Neo4jGraphStore class from LangChain. This class provides a

convenient interface for interacting with a Neo4j database and storing knowledge graphs.

Next, we create an instance of Neo4jGraphStore by providing the necessary connection

details: the Neo4j database URL, username, and password. Make sure to replace

"your_neo4j_url", "your_username", and "your_password" with the appropriate values for

your Neo4j instance.

Finally, we call the write_graph method of the graph_store instance, passing in the

graph_documents list obtained from the previous step. This method serializes the

knowledge graph and writes it to the Neo4j database.

Storing the knowledge graph in a Neo4j database allows us to ensure that it’s persistent and

can be easily queried and retrieved when needed. The graph structure of Neo4j allows for

efficient representation and traversal of the complex relationships and entities present in the

knowledge graph.

In the next step, we'll set up the components for retrieving knowledge from the graph and

generating responses using the retrieved context.

It's important to note that while this tutorial uses Neo4j as the graph database, LangChain

supports other graph databases as well, such as Amazon Neptune and TinkerPop
compatible databases like Gremlin Server. You can swap out the Neo4jGraphStore with the

appropriate graph store implementation for your chosen database.

**Step 4: Retrieve knowledge for RAG**

Now that we have stored the knowledge graph in a database, we can set up the

components for retrieving relevant knowledge from the graph based on user queries and

generating responses using the retrieved context. This is the core functionality of a RAG

application.
```
               from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine
               from llama_index.core.retrievers import KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever
               from llama_index.core.response_synthesis import ResponseSynthesizer

```
https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 7/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp
```
               # Retrieve Knowledge for RAG
               graph_rag_retriever = KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever(storage_context=graph_store.stor
               query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(graph_rag_retriever)

```
**[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)**

First, we import the necessary classes from LlamaIndex: RetrieverQueryEngine,

KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever, and ResponseSynthesizer .

RetrieverQueryEngine is a query engine that uses a retriever to fetch relevant context from
a data source (in our case, the knowledge graph) and then synthesizes a response using

that context.

KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever is a specialized retriever that can retrieve relevant

information from a knowledge graph stored in a database.

ResponseSynthesizer is responsible for generating a final response by combining the

retrieved context with a language model.

Next, we create an instance of KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever by passing in the

storage_context from our graph_store instance. This storage_context contains the

necessary information to connect to and query the Neo4j database, where we stored the

knowledge graph. We also set verbose=True to enable detailed logging during the retrieval

process.

Then, we initialize a RetrieverQueryEngine using the from_args method and passing in our

graph_rag_retriever instance. This query engine will handle the entire process of retrieving

relevant context from the knowledge graph and generating a response based on that

context.

With these components set up, we are now ready to query the knowledge graph and

generate responses using the retrieved context. In the next step, we'll see how to do this in

practice.

**Step 5: Query the knowledge graph and generate a response**

Finally, we can query the knowledge graph and generate responses using the retrieved

context.
```
               def query_and_synthesize(query):
                 retrieved_context = query_engine.query(query)
                 response = response_synthesizer.synthesize(query, retrieved_context)
                  print(f"Query: {query}")
                  print(f"Answer: {response}/n")
               # Initialize the ResponseSynthesizer instance
               response_synthesizer = ResponseSynthesizer(llm)
               # Query 1
               query_and_synthesize("Where does Sarah work?")
               # Query 2
               query_and_synthesize("Who works for prismaticAI?")
               # Query 3
               query_and_synthesize("Does Michael work for the same company as Sarah?")

```
**[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)**

In this example, we define three different queries related to the employees and the

company described in the text data. For each query, we use the query_engine to retrieve

the relevant context from the knowledge graph, create an instance of ResponseSynthesizer,

and call its synthesize method with the query and retrieved context.

The ResponseSynthesizer uses the language model and the retrieved context to generate a

final response to the query, which is then printed to the console, matching the answers in

the first section of this article.
## **Knowledge Graphs in Real-world Scenarios**

https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 8/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp

While the tutorial demonstrates using a knowledge graph for RAG applications with

relatively simple text, real-world scenarios often involve more complex and diverse data sets.

Additionally, the input data may come in various file formats beyond plain text. In this

section, we'll explore how the knowledge graph-based RAG application can be extended to

handle such scenarios.

**Handling large and diverse data sets**

As the size and complexity of the input data increase, the knowledge graph extraction

process may become more challenging. Here are some strategies to handle large and

diverse data sets:

**Distributed knowledge graph construction** : For very large data sets, the knowledge

graph construction process can be parallelized and distributed across multiple

machines or a cluster. This can be achieved by partitioning the data set and extracting

knowledge graphs in parallel, which can then be merged into a single, unified

knowledge graph.

**Incremental knowledge graph updates** : Instead of rebuilding the entire knowledge

graph from scratch whenever new data becomes available, an incremental approach

can be adopted. This involves updating the existing knowledge graph with new

information while preserving the existing knowledge and relationships.

**Domain-specific knowledge graph extraction** : For data sets spanning multiple domains

or topics, it may be beneficial to develop domain-specific knowledge graph extraction

pipelines. These pipelines can be tailored to the terminology, entities, and relationships

relevant to each domain, improving the accuracy and completeness of the extracted

knowledge graphs.

**Knowledge graph fusion and integration** : When working with data from multiple

sources, the extracted knowledge graphs may need to be fused or integrated into a

unified representation. This can involve techniques such as entity resolution, relationship

alignment, and conflict resolution to ensure consistency and avoid redundancy.

**Handling different file types**

In real-world scenarios, data can come in various file formats, such as PDFs, Word

documents, spreadsheets, or even structured data formats like JSON or XML. To handle

these different file types, you can use the following strategies:

**File conversion:** Many libraries and tools are available to convert different file formats

into plain text. For example, you can use libraries like pdfplumber or tika to extract text

from PDF files or python-docx to extract text from Word documents.

**Custom file loaders** : LangChain provides a DocumentLoader interface that allows you to

create custom loaders for specific file types. You can implement your own loader by

subclassing DocumentLoader and overriding the load method to handle the desired file

format.

**Structured data handling:** For structured data formats like JSON or XML, you can use

libraries like pandas or lxml to parse and extract the relevant information before passing

it to the knowledge graph extraction pipeline.

**Multimodal knowledge graph extraction** : In some cases, the input data may be

multimodal, containing both text and other modalities like images or videos. In such

scenarios, you can explore techniques for multimodal knowledge graph extraction,

which combines text-based extraction with computer vision or other modality-specific

methods.

These strategies will help you extend the knowledge graph-based RAG application to handle
more complex and diverse data sets, as well as a wider range of file types.

It's important to note that as the complexity of the input data increases, the knowledge

graph extraction process may require more domain-specific customization and tuning to

ensure accurate and reliable results.
## **Challenges**

Setting up knowledge graphs for RAG applications in the real world can be a complex task

with several challenges. Let’s explore some of them:

https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=… 9/15

18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp

**Knowledge graph construction**

Building a high-quality knowledge graph is a complex and time-consuming process that

requires significant domain expertise and effort. Extracting entities, relationships, and facts

from various data sources and integrating them into a coherent knowledge graph can be

challenging, especially for large and diverse datasets. It involves understanding the domain,

identifying relevant information, and structuring it in a way that accurately captures the

relationships and semantics.

**Data integration and interoperability**

RAG applications often need to integrate data from multiple heterogeneous sources, each

with its own structure, format, and semantics. Ensuring data consistency, resolving conflicts,

and mapping entities and relationships across different data sources is non-trivial. It requires

careful data cleaning, transformation, and mapping to ensure that the knowledge graph

accurately represents the information from various sources.

**Knowledge graph maintenance and evolution**

Knowledge graphs are not static. They need to be continuously updated and maintained as

new information becomes available or existing information changes. Keeping the knowledge

graph up-to-date and consistent with the evolving data sources can be a resource-intensive

process. It involves monitoring changes in the data sources, identifying relevant updates,

and propagating those updates to the knowledge graph while maintaining its integrity and

consistency.

**Scalability and performance**

As the knowledge graph grows in size and complexity, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval,

and querying of the graph data becomes increasingly challenging. Scalability and

performance issues can arise, particularly for large-scale RAG applications with high query

volumes. Optimizing the knowledge graph storage, indexing, and query processing

techniques becomes crucial to maintaining acceptable performance levels.

**Query complexity and reasoning**

While knowledge graphs excel at representing complex relationships and enabling multi-hop

reasoning, formulating and executing complex queries that leverage these capabilities can

be difficult. Developing efficient query processing and reasoning algorithms is an active

area of research. Understanding the knowledge graph system's query language and

reasoning capabilities is important to effectively utilize its full potential.

**Lack of standardization**

There is a lack of widely adopted standards for representing and querying knowledge

graphs, which can lead to interoperability issues and vendor lock-in. Different knowledge

graph systems may use different data models, query languages, and APIs, making it

challenging to switch between them or integrate with other systems. Adopting or developing

standards can facilitate interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in.

**Explainability and transparency**

While knowledge graphs can provide explainable and transparent reasoning, ensuring that

the reasoning process is easily interpretable and understandable to end-users can be a

challenge, especially for complex queries or reasoning paths. Developing user-friendly

interfaces and explanations that clearly communicate the reasoning process and its

underlying assumptions is important for user trust and adoption.

**Domain-specific challenges**

Depending on the domain and application, there may be additional challenges specific to

that domain, such as handling domain-specific terminology, ontologies, or data formats. For

example, in the medical domain, dealing with complex medical terminologies, coding

systems, and privacy concerns can add additional layers of complexity to the knowledge

graph setup and usage.

Despite these challenges, knowledge graphs offer significant advantages for RAG

applications, particularly in terms of representing structured knowledge, enabling complex

reasoning, and providing explainable and transparent results. Addressing these challenges

through careful knowledge graph design, data integration strategies, and efficient query

processing techniques is crucial for successfully implementing knowledge graph-based RAG

applications.

## **Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we explored the power of knowledge graphs to create more accurate,

informative, and contextually relevant responses. We started by understanding the

fundamental concepts behind knowledge graphs and their role in RAG applications. Then,

we walked through a hands-on example, extracting a knowledge graph from text data,

storing it in a Neo4j database, and using it to retrieve relevant context for user queries.

Finally, we demonstrated how to use the retrieved context to generate responses using the

structured knowledge in the graph.
