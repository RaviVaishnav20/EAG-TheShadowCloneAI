He became the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth \u2014 a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u82f1\u96c4, Konohagakure no Eiy\u016b, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).

Function Calling Model Context Protocol (MCP) AI Agents Key Differences Future Considerations How MCP Works MCP Server Architecture How to use MCP Resources for MCP Official MCP resources Community-built MCP servers \ud83d\udd0d Why MCP is a Breakthrough Over the past year, AI models have evolved rapidly \u2014 GPT-4, Claude Sonnet 3.5, DeepSeek R1 , etc. Models now offer better reasoning, fewer hallucinations, and greater accuracy. However, despite these advancements, AI applications struggle to integrate with existing systems . For example, current AI applications lack built-in support for tasks like: \u2705 Web searches \u2705 Sending emails \u2705 Publishing blog posts Each of these tasks can be done individually , but fully integrating them into one AI system is a major challenge . \ud83d\udd39 Imagine a better workflow inside an IDE (Integrated Development Environment): \ud83d\udca1 Ask AI to query a local database for existing data to assist with development \ud83d\udca1 Have AI search GitHub Issues to identify known bugs \ud83d\udca1 Use AI to send PR feedback directly to Slack \ud83d\udca1 Let AI query and modify AWS/Azure configurations for deployment These MCP-powered workflows are becoming a reality. Cursor MCP and Windsurf MCP are leading examples of this transformation. \ud83d\udca1 Try Cursor MCP + browser tools to see how MCP integrates Chrome DevTools console logs into AI workflows. \ud83d\udd11 Why is AI integration with existing services so slow? 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Data Privacy Concerns \u2014 Enterprises take a long time to approve AI system integrations. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Lack of a Universal Protocol \u2014 No standard exists for AI models to connect to APIs, databases, and tools. MCP = The Solution MCP, developed by Claude (Anthropic) , is an open, universal, and standardized protocol that enables AI models to seamlessly integrate with external services . If OpenAI had introduced MCP-like protocols when GPT-4 launched , the industry might have quickly adopted them. However, OpenAI chose a closed system (GPTs) instead. Anthropic\u2019s Claude now leads the push for open AI integration with MCP, allowing multiple organizations and communities to contribute MCP servers . \ud83d\udd25 Official MCP Integrations Here are real-world examples of MCP integrations: \ud83d\udd17 Official MCP Servers Git \u2014 Read, modify, and search repositories GitHub \u2014 Repo management, file operations, API access Google Maps \u2014 Fetch location data PostgreSQL \u2014 Read-only database queries Slack \u2014 Send and query Slack messages \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f Third-Party Platforms Supporting MCP Grafana \u2014 Query and visualize data JetBrains IDEs \u2014 AI-enhanced coding Stripe \u2014 AI-powered payment processing \ud83c\udf0e Community MCP Servers AWS \u2014 AI-driven cloud resource management Atlassian (Jira, Confluence) \u2014 Query project issues, manage documentation Google Calendar \u2014 Schedule, search, and modify events Kubernetes \u2014 Manage clusters, deployments, and services Twitter (X) \u2014 Automate",

At this point, you might be wondering: Didn\u2019t OpenAI introduce GPT Function Calling in 2023, which can achieve similar functionality? Didn\u2019t we previously discuss AI Agents , which are designed to integrate different services? Why do we now need MCP ? What\u2019s the Difference Between Function Calling, AI Agents, and MCP? Function Calling AI models execute functions automatically based on context. It acts as a bridge between AI models and external systems, but each AI platform implements it differently. Model Context Protocol (MCP) A standardized protocol , similar to USB Type-C in electronics. MCP enables seamless interaction between AI models, APIs, and data sources. It replaces fragmented AI Agent integrations with a universal approach, allowing AI systems to be more reliable and efficient. AI Agent An intelligent system that autonomously performs tasks to achieve a goal. Unlike traditional AI chat, which only provides suggestions, AI Agents can analyze, make decisions, and take actions automatically. Key Differences Simply put: MCP standardizes the way AI models interact with different services and platforms. AI Agents use MCP to understand available services, decide which ones to use, and execute actions using Function Calling. Function Calling executes the function, but MCP provides the necessary standardization for AI Agents to use it efficiently. Benefits of MCP for the AI Community \u2705 Open Standard for Service Providers Companies can expose MCP-compatible APIs and features. \u2705 Developers Don\u2019t Need to Reinvent the Wheel Instead of building custom integrations, developers can use existing open-source MCP services to enhance AI Agents. Why Did MCP Gain Wide Adoption? Claude\u2019s MCP initiative was quickly embraced because integrating AI models with existing systems or third-party services is often complicated and inefficient . Challenges with Existing AI Frameworks Several frameworks support AI Agent development, such as: LangChain Tools LlamaIndex Vercel AI SDK However, they each have significant limitations : LangChain & LlamaIndex \u2014 Although open-source, these frameworks are too complex with high-level abstractions , making real-world implementation difficult. Their over-commercialization also limits ecosystem development. Vercel AI SDK \u2014 Well-structured but tightly coupled with Next.js , making it less flexible for other frameworks and languages. Why Claude\u2019s Timing Was Perfect for MCP Claude Sonnet 3.5 was already highly regarded by developers . MCP provided an open standard , encouraging widespread adoption from companies and communities . If Claude maintains an open ecosystem , MCP will continue to thrive. \ud83d\udd0d Final Thoughts MCP fills the gap between Function Calling and AI Agents , providing a universal standard that makes AI integration simpler, more scalable, and more effective . Would you like help setting up an MCP integration for your AI Agent? \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How MCP Works MCP Architecture The MCP system consists of five main components : 1\ufe0f\u20e3 MCP Hosts \u2014 Apps that connect to LLMs ( e.g., Cursor, Claude Desktop, Cline ) 2\ufe0f\u20e3 MCP Clients \u2014 Middleware maintaining 1:1 connections with servers 3\ufe0f\u20e3 MCP Servers \u2014 Expose tools, APIs, and context to AI models 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Local Data Sources \u2014 Files, databases, internal APIs 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Remote",

Do You Need to Build Your Own MCP Server? No, you don\u2019t need to develop your own MCP servers ! One of MCP\u2019s greatest advantages is that it follows a universal standard , meaning developers don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel . (That said, if you\u2019re learning, building your own MCP server can be a great practice.) Where to Start? A good starting point is the official list of MCP Servers , which are maintained by the MCP organization .

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install 'markitdown[all]'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *",

    "chunk": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa, and the West Indies. While traditionally, cricket has largely been played by men, Women's cricket has experienced large growth in the 21st century. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country, and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.",

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics",

SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. Prior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and served as the company's Chairman and CEO.

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles. [9] The strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other intellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. 6 SolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team 7 Tesla Motors, \u2018Gigafactory\u2019, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory 8 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 9 Ibid. 4 On the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that \u2018all our patents belong to you.\u2019 [10] He explained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its intellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, and address the carbon crisis.

In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle 8 performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio\u2014as of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas.

[25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla\u2019s patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24 Ibid. 25 Maulin Shah, \u2018Auto Industry May Ignore Tesla\u2019s Patents\u2019, Enivsion IP, 26 June 2014, http://envisionip.com/blog/2014/06/26/auto - industry - may - ignore - tesla - patents/ 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 10 **Image** **Patent Publications by Year** * 2005: 0 * 2006: 0 * 2007: 2 * 2008: 4 * 2009: 9 * 2010: 35 * 2011: 36 * 2012: 61 * 2013: 109 * 2014: 39 **Founders and Top Inventors by Number of Patents** * Taro Yano: 16 * Kurt Russell Getty: 12 * Peter Dave Russellmon:",

[33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019.

[38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019. [39] Tesla Motors has been involved in a number of legal skirmishes in respect of intellectual property. In a 2013 dispute, Tesla Motors was involved in a skirmish with pointSET.

This system essentially allows owner to pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin of a plugged-in Model S. Of course, this is a feature that we\u2019re sure all Model S owners use on almost a daily basis. However, there may be an issue that could prevent Model S owners from accessing this feature in the future. It seems Tesla\u2019s remote access system may infringe upon a patent held by pointSET. [41] On the 30th April 2013, an attorney for pointSET sent a letter to Tesla Motors, alleging that \u2018Tesla induces infringement of claim 6 of United States Patent No. 7,379,541.\u2019 [42] The patent concerned a \u2018method and apparatus for setting programmable features of a motor vehicle.\u2019 43 The letter stated that \u2018pointSET is offering a one-time, fully-paid licensing flat fee of $500,000' that \u2018will cover both past and future use of the technology.\u2019 [44] In response, Tesla Motors sought a declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. [45] Tesla Motors requested a judgment that \u2018Tesla does not infringe and has not infringed, directly or indirectly, the \u2018541 patent.\u2019 [46] Tesla Motors also asked for a ruling that \u2018the Model S Beta app does not infringe and has not infringed, directly or indirectly, the \u2018541 patent.\u2019 [47] Tesla Motors requested that 41 Eric Loveday, \u2018Tesla in Patent Dispute with pointSET over How Automaker Remotely Controls Cabin Temperature of Model S\u2019, Inside EVs, 2013, http://insideevs.com/tesla - in - patent - dispute - with - pointset - over how - automaker - remotely - controls - cabin - temperature - of - model - s/ 42 Ibid. 43 Ibid. 44 Ibid. 45 *Tesla Motors Inc.* v *Pointset Corporation*, United States District Court for the Northern District of California (2013) http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/ca/TESLAsuit.pdf 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid. 15 \u2018pointSET, and all persons acting on its behalf or in concert with it, be permanently enjoined and restrained from charging, orally or in writing, that the \u2018514 patent is infringed, directly or indirectly, by Tesla or the Model S Beta app.\u2019",

[49] Moreover, the company asked that \u2018Tesla be awarded such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\u2019 [50] Such disputes are not uncommon. In my 2011 book *Intellectual Property and Climate* *Change: Inventing Clean Technologies,* I considered the significant patent litigation in respect of green cars and transportation. [51] There was an epic dispute between Paice LLC and Toyota Motors over patents regarding hybrid cars, such as the Toyota Prius. Toyota Motors was indignant at the litigation, calling its opponent a \u2018patent shark\u2019. However, the company fared poorly in the long-winded litigation. This conflict was eventually settled, with Toyota Motors paying royalties to Paice LLC. The dispute highlighted that there are major patent thickets surrounding green cars and green transportation.

[54] He implored: \u2018We would love to see Tesla commit their patents explicitly under an agreement like the Defensive Patent License, which sets a clear standard that patents are to be both shared and used for good.\u2019 [55] Kamdar observed that Musk\u2019s stance on patent law was supported by a recent study by MIT\u2019s Catherine Tucker on \u2018The Effect of Patent Litigation and Patent Assertion Entities on Entrepreneurial Activity\u2019 [PDF].

(Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, IBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: \u201cIBM now appears to be claiming the right to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick.\u201d) The questions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new. And, given enough time, courts will have to answer them. [59] There has been similar issues arising in the context of battles over gene patents \u2013 there has been much discussion as to whether Genetic Technologies Limited would be estopped from taking action, in light of its statements.

Julie Samuels of the public policy think thank, Engine, commented: \u2018What you\u2019re looking at here is the beginning of a new culture with regard to patents.\u2019 [61] She observed: \u2018A lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they\u2019re trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.\u2019 [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk\u2019s comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: \u2018While this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.\u2019 [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the \u2018litigation lottery\u2019 as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them.

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: \u2018If Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.\u2019 [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for \u2018good faith\u2019 uses of its patents \u2014 which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against \u2018bad faith\u2019 uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce\u2019.

The writers promoted open and collaborative responses to climate change: \u2018Tackling climate change will not only require unprecedented transformations in our systems of commerce and industry, it will also require fundamental changes to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society.* *[87]* He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at",

Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports. [101] Seba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.\u2019 [102] He observed that \u2018even worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.\u2019 [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation: How Silicon Valley will Make Oil,* *Nuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Vehicles and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030*, Silicon Valley, Clean Planet Ventures, 2014. 101 Ibid., 102. 102 Ibid., 103. 103 Ibid., 104. 28 Seba was impressed by the modular design architecture of electric vehicles. He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and",

[107] He maintained that \u2018solar, the electric vehicle, and the autonomous 104 Ibid., 111. 105 Ibid., 126. 106 Ibid., 127. 107 Ibid., 7. 29 vehicle started out as different sets of products and markets, but their symbiosis will complement and accelerate one another\u2019s technological development and adoption in the marketplace.\u2019 [108] Seba envisaged: Increasing investments in electricity storage technologies in the automotive industry have led to more innovation and a subsequent drop in the cost of batteries like Lithium-Ion. As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] Seba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs\u2019. [110] He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019 [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: \u2018By opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it\u2019s better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.\u2019 [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: \u2018Both companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.\u2019 [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in *Slate,* Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: \u2018This might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.\u2019 [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, \u2018Tesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology\u2019, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent",

Very impressed by the news that electric car company, Tesla Motors have frozen their patent portfolio to help accelerate sustainable transport. In the spirit of the open source movement, the company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk announced that Tesla won\u2019t raise patent lawsuits against anyone who uses their technology in good faith. Just last week, a wall of patents was removed from the company\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters to demonstrate the message. [127] Branson provides a somewhat scrambled account of the nature and the role of patent law. Branson cited former The B Team CEO, Derek Handley who said: \u2018By holding on tightly to the knowledge and protection of ideas and intellectual property that is enabling this race to gain momentum, they are holding the world back from getting to where we all want it to 124 Ibid. 125 Ibid. 126 Richard Branson, \u2018Breaking Down the Patent Wall\u2019, Virgin.com, 19 June 2014, http://www.virgin.com/richard - branson/breaking - down - the - patent - wall 127 Ibid. 33 be.\u2019 [128] He commented: \u2018At Virgin, we welcome competition \u2013 it challenges us to constantly innovative and improve.\u2019 [129] Branson was of the view: \u2018We have never sought to monopolise a market, but instead to disrupt, improve and reimagine the current state of play to the benefit of customers.\u2019 [130] He affirmed the announcement by Tesla Motors: \u2018This latest Tesla announcement is a win for innovation, technology and customers, and great step in the right direction for business.\u2019 [131] Branson sounds a little envious of the marketing success of Elon Musk\u2019s announcement in respect of open innovation. Branson has also been a supporter of Musk\u2019s efforts. [ 132] He has commented: \u2018My good friend Elon Musk is in the fast lane of electric vehicle development as Tesla power ahead with sales and growth\u2019. [133] Branson noted: \u2018However some Virgin staff notified me that Tesla are facing some opposition from industry incumbents who want to prevent Tesla from selling directly to customers.\u2019 [134] He observed: \u2018Whilst nobody wants to undermine peoples livelihoods, if we are to conduct our businesses and industries in ways that profitably help people and the planet some things will have to change.\u2019 [135] Branson argued: \u2018In this instance, I think that, by shaking up the United States automaker industry, Tesla are doing a very good thing, and I 128 Ibid. 129 Ibid. 130 Ibid. 131 Ibid. 132 Richard Branson, \u2018Allow Tesla Motors to Sell Directly to Consumers\u2019, Virgin.Com, 19 August 2013, http://www.virgin.com/richard - branson/allow - tesla - motors - to - sell - directly - to - consumers 133 Ibid. 134 Ibid. 135 Ibid. 34 would greatly encourage you to sign this White House petition (organised by the public) to allow Tesla Motors to sell directly to consumers in all 50 states.\u2019 [136] There has been pessimism amongst some critics that the automobile industry will squander the present offered by Tesla Motors.

Perlow concluded: \u2018Unless our world governments step in and give them huge incentives to do otherwise, I don\u2019t see the big auto manufacturers taking advantage of Musk\u2019s gifts and breaking up a century-old romance with Big Oil.\u2019 [140] 136 Ibid. 137 Jason Perlow, \u2018Why Detroit Will Squander Tesla\u2019s Patent Present\u2019, ZDNet, 17 June 2014, http://www.zdnet.com/why - detroit - will - squander - teslas - patent - present - 7000030497/ 138 Ibid. 139 Ibid. 140 Ibid. 35 James Bessen, an economist from the Boston University School of Law, provided a thoughtful historical analysis of Tesla\u2019s patent-sharing in the *Harvard Business Review* .

In its annual report, Tesla Motors highlights the role of marketing in respect of electric cars. The company notes: \u2018As the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant, fully electric vehicle that achieves market-leading range on a single charge, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so\u2019. [144] Tesla Motors has certainly excelled at marketing and branding clean technology (which has sometimes been rather dour by comparison to other sectors). Elon Musk has certainly shown a Steve Jobs-like elan and bravura at salesmanship and promotion. The company Tesla Motors has also been involved in battles over other forms of intellectual property \u2014 most notably, in respect of trade marks relating to the United States, [145] and China. [146] It is striking that the company has not espoused an open source philosophy when it comes to trade mark law. In its annual report for 2012, Tesla Motors highlighted that its trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings: 144 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report",

We have filed trademark applications for our Tesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our vehicles. Certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior use of similar marks. If we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries, our ability to challenge third party users of the Tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted. In addition, there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the Tesla marks in these countries. Such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla marks in these countries. If we were prevented from using the Tesla marks in any or all of these countries, we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets. [147] The company seems particularly sensitive to some of the challenges in respect of trademark law. Tesla Motors noted: \u2018Existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection.\u2019 [148] The company emphasized: \u2018In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult.\u2019 [149] 147 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 148 Ibid. 149 Ibid. 38 In the United States, Tesla Motors was involved in an interesting conflict with Ford Motors over a trade mark application in respect of the name, \u2018Model E\u2019.

[152] Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that **it had resolved the** **matter** though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

He... demanded that Tesla stop all sales and marketing activities in China, shut down showrooms and charging facilities, and pay him 23.9 million yuan ($3.85 million) in compensation. It appears that Zhan finally got his pay day. Tesla recently said it resolved the dispute \u2013 this time via a direct settlement with Zhan rather than relying on the Chinese court system. [153] In August 2014, Tesla Motors finally reached a settlement to end the China trademark dispute. There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names.

Without decisive action to lay the groundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized solar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. SolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly convenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than the entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired with batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than is consumed by the entirety of human civilization.

Even if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with photovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for the next 25 years. We absolutely believe that solar power can and will become the world\u2019s predominant source of energy within our lifetimes, but there are obviously a **lot** of panels that have to be manufactured and installed in order for that to happen. The plans we are announcing today, while substantial compared to current industry, are small in that context. [196] There has been much debate about whether this strategy of SolarCity will be successful. More generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion of solar photovoltaics. Tony Seba has highlighted that solar energy \u2013 coupled with innovative 196 Ibid. 50 financial models \u2013 will disrupt traditional business models in respect of energy. [197] In his book on *Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change*, Mark Diesendorf highlights the significance of solar photovoltaics. [198] He emphasized: \u2018PV\u2019s low and decreasing prices, huge resource, low environmental and health impacts, low land use compared with agriculture and widely available materials (at least for silicon crystal technologies) gives confidence that, with geographic diversity of collectors, it can make a substantial contribution to future electricity demand.\u2019 [199] In his essay, \u2018The New Turning Point\u2019, Al Gore has emphasized that the key question in addressing climate change is how \u2018quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization\u2019. [200] He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted. The cost of electricity from photovoltaic, or PV, solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries. By 2020 \u2013 as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline \u2013 more than 80 percent of the world's people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources.

    "chunk": "DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this",

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]",

Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste.

Traditionally, pathologists were counting and detecting cells manually but this can lead to a high level of error and subjectivity, which is not something we want in sensitive scenarios like disease diagnosis. Therefore, they have turned to deep learning to count and detect cells for them. Even so, these biomedical images present a number of challenges for the deep learning algorithms to learn and make predictions well. 3 Challenges presented to ML and DL algorithms Overlapped and clustered cells make it difficult for algorithms to properly segment the image and distinguish cell from cell. Weakly stained cells create difficulties for the model to distinguish artefact noise and the image background from the target cells. Diverse cell morphologies prevent the algorithm from generalising more broadly and making predictions. CNNs and other deep learning techniques are already being implemented within the field. However, these solutions are unique to the domain and have bespoke datasets ultimately, not offering a whole lot of generalisability within biomedicine. In this blog post, I want to touch on the existing studies that have used YOLO and the gaps they have. I also want to touch on the different YOLO models currently out there and their key features. What is YOLO? No, its not the risk inspiring and motivating YOLO (You Only live Once\u2026 But in the words of Dwight Schrute \u2018 False, you live every day. You only die once \u2019 but I digress), this YOLO is different. You Only Look Once, is a state of the art object detection algorithm that leverages CNNs to detect objects in real time. It is a single shot detector that passes an image through the CNN once, producing classifications and bounding boxes of the objects within that image. YOLO has demonstrated a high level of generalisability and versa- tility in a variety of domains such as security, crowd and trac monitoring, often out- performing Region-based CNNs and Single Shot detectors.First built in 2015, the framework has undergone continuous modifications and improvements to achieve better performance. As of June 2024, I believe YOLOv10 is the latest release. For the upcoming blogs, my focus will only be on YOLO versions 5, 8 and 9. In general there are three main components to YOLO\u2019s architecture YOLO basic architecture Backbone: The backbone is responsible for extracting valuable characteristics and then generating feature maps from the input image. A CNN that has been extensively pre- trained on large image datasets is commonly used for the backbone. Popular choices for backbones include VGG16, ResNet50, CSP-Darknet53 and EffcientRep Neck: The neck is made up of two components; the Spatial Pyramid Pooling",

    "chunk": "(SPP) and Path Aggregation Network (PAN). Both components work to combine the extracted feature maps generated by the backbone through a process of feature aggregation and propagate them to the head. Head : The head handles the aggregated features from the neck and makes predictions on the image relating to the bounding boxes coordinate estimates, classification scores class probabilities . Often, studies have tried different combinations of backbones, necks, and heads to investigate model speed, accuracy, and detection performance. YOLO heads are also interchangeable across different YOLO models. YOLO in Biomedical Images A list of related work where YOLO has been used detect cells. Existing studies relating to YOLO detecting on biomedical images revolve around assessing different model\u2019s speed and accuracy (see the above table). Nair (2021) deployed a YOLOv4 model for mitotic nuclei detection in breast cancer histopathological images. While a computationally efficient and reasonably fast, the study suffered in model performance when given pixel and colour normalised images and was deemed unsuitable for full scale deployment. In another study, Topuz (2023) deployed YOLO models V3, V5, V7 and V8 to compare how accurately each could detect mitosis cells as an indicator for lung cancer. Models V7 and V8 outperformed others in correctly detecting mitosis cells despite the data imbalance and low-quality input images. V7 and V8 exhibited higher performance due to a combination of higher image resolution processing, improved module innovations and new loss functions. Others have performed ablation studies to determine which components of YOLO\u2019s architecture yield the best detection results. Alam and Islam (2019) deployed a Tiny YOLO model to count and detect blood cells by replacing the primary backbone of the YOLO model with other CNN architectures like VGG-16, ResNet50 and Mobile Net. Results showed that the standalone Tiny YOLO drastically outper- formed the other CNN architectures and generalised well to unseen data sets. Yucel (2023) compared the performance of a YOLOv5 (baseline) to a YOLOv5 with a transformer mechanism (transformer) to detect mitosis cells in neuroendocrine tumours, with the aim of creating a high speed and accurate detector. Results showed that the transformer consistently detected more mitosis cells than the baseline and image augmen- tation techniques also boosted the transformer model\u2019s speed and accuracy. While these YOLO models have been chosen for their accuracy and speed, they do not explicitly address the challenges of overlapped cells, diverse cell morphologies or weakly stained cells. Therefore, I would like to see how different YOLO versions perform on a given dataset and the extent to which they can addresss those challenges. Summary of YOLO versions to date. In my next blog, I\u2019ll cover the dataset available and any EDA I performed. Stay tuned! Don\u2019t forget to YOLO :) All work is sourced from my paper : Analysis of different YOLO variants Yolo Object Detection Biomedical Data Science Deep Learning Follow Written by Johanna Jones 9 Followers \u00b7 7 Following I am a Masters Student, studying a Masters in Data Science.

SEBI called for information from the CRAs regarding the downgrade of the ratings assigned to Gensol. The CRAs submitted that pursuant to news reports concerning default by BluSmart Mobility Private Limited (BluSmart), a related party of Gensol, on February 24, 2025, the CRAs initiated a review of the ratings assigned to the instruments of Gensol. 16. As per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that it was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no impact on the Company. **___________________________________________________________________________** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited** **Page 4 of 29** 17. The CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, Gensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol shared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated that Gensol was regular in its debt servicing. 18. CARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned to it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) purportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders. 19. However, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the issuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, **both the lenders categorically** **denied having issued s** **uc** **h letters** .

It can be noted from the above table, that the first instance of default occurred on December 31, 2024. The Company however continued to submit statements to the CRAs certifying there was no delay or default in servicing any loans (No Default Statements). The statements for December 2024, January 2025 and February 2025 were submitted on January 6, 2025, February 10, 2025 and March 3, 2025, respectively. The text of the No Default Statement submitted for the month of February 2025 is reproduced below: *\u201cWe hereby confirm that as on date and in the month ended [Feb \u2013 2025] there are no* *over dues or default on payment of interest/ instalment obligations on loans from* *banks/ financial institutions.\u201d* 22.

It was noted that out of Rs. 977.75 Crore availed by the Company from IREDA and PFC as term loans, Rs. 663.89 Crore was for purchasing 6,400 Electric Vehicles. As per the submissions made by Gensol, EVs were procured by the Company and subsequently leased to BluSmart, a related party. 26. Gensol, vide its response dated February 14, 2025, acknowledged that it had procured only 4,704 electric vehicles (EVs) till date, as against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited** **Page 8 of 29** the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz.

On September 27, 2023, Gensol was disbursed a loan of Rs. 117.47 Crore from PFC into its designated \u201cGensol Engineering Limited\u2013PFC\u2013Construction Fund Account\u201d (Bank A/c No. 058605004913 with ICICI Bank). This was supplemented by Rs. 29.37 Crore transferred from another internal account of the Company. The total funds credited in the account stood at Rs. 146.84 Crore. 47. On September 29, 2023, the Company transferred Rs. 134.14 Crore from the above ICICI Bank Account to another bank account of Gensol viz. Gensol Engineering Limited\u2013PFC\u2013Construction Contract Expense Account having Account No. 058605004917 with ICICI Bank. On the same day, Gensol from the said bank account transferred funds of Rs. 134.14 Crore to Go-Auto (ICICI Bank A/c No. 103705000861). The balance in Go-Auto\u2019s account prior to this transaction was Rs. 0.19 Crore. Immediately upon receipt of these funds **___________________________________________________________________________** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited** **Page 14 of 29** (September 29, 2023), Go-Auto transferred Rs. 96.69 Crore to the following entities: (a) Rs. 46.65 Crore was transferred to Gensol Consultant Pvt. Ltd. (Axis bank A/c No. 921020036427118), which had a prior balance of Rs. 5.07 Lakh (b) Rs. 50.04 Crore was transferred to Capbridge Ventures LLP (A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), which had a balance of Rs. 97,209 before the transaction. On the same date, Capbridge transferred Rs. 40 Crore to Gensol Ventures Pvt. Ltd. (A/c No. 058605500770 with ICICI Bank), which had a debit balance of Rs. 38.12 Crore prior to this transaction. 48. Based on the fund trail and account balances, it is prima facie observed that Rs. 96.69 Crore was diverted to promoter and promoter-linked entities, bypassing the stated end-use of the PFC loan. 49. A pictorial representation of the above movement of funds is given below: **Image** GENSOL CONSULTANT PRIVATE LIMITED CAPBRIDGE VENTURES LLP GENSOL VENTURE PRIVATE LIMITED 50. Further, it was noted that Capbridge had transferred funds back to Go-Auto, through circular movement of funds which originated from Go-Auto, itself. It was noted that an amount of Rs. 10 Crore was circulated four times by Go-Auto itself through Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd. and Go-Solar Venture Private Limited on 04/01/2024.

Further, it was noted that Gensol Consultant transferred back funds amounting to Rs.46.65 Crore to Go-Auto, using the funds taken from Gensol EV Lease. The amount transferred by Gensol EV Lease was out of a loan received by it from IREDA (IREDA sanctioned two loans to Gensol EV Lease in FY 2024). Details of the above transfers are given below: |Date Party Name and Amount|To party|Date|To party|Amount (Rs. In Crores)|To party|Amount (Rs. In Crores)|To party|Amount (Rs.

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a *consolidated basis*, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted *prima-facie* that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim",

It was further noted during the examination that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi\u2014current promoters and directors of Gensol\u2014were also directors in Wellray until April 15, 2020. Further, up to the financial year 2019\u201320, the entire shareholding in Wellray was held by Puneet Singh Jaggi and Gensol Ventures Private Limited \u2013both promoters of Gensol. 59. Presently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of Wellray is held by Lalit Solanki, who was employed as Regulatory Affairs Manager at the Gensol Group until December 2018, as per information available on LinkedIn. Given the same, it is *prima facie* observed that Wellray is connected to Gensol, both through historical promoter positions and current key managerial associations. 60.

In view of the above, it is *prima facie* observed that Gensol and its promoters/promoter related entities have funded Wellray for trading in the scrip of Gensol which is a violation of the restrictions contained in section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013. As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of Gensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions. ***Disclosures made by the Company*** 80. It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with",

In this regard, representative of NSE visited the plant site of Gensol Electric Vehicle Private Limited located at Gat No. 877, Next to Mahindra Towers, Khed, Nighoje, Chakan, Pune \u2013 410501 on April 09, 2025. 82. It was found during the visit that there was no manufacturing activity at the plant with only 2-3 labourers present there. The NSE official called for details of electricity bills of the unit and it was observed that the maximum amount billed by Mahavitaran during last 12 months was Rs. 1,57,037.01 for the month of December 2024. Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no manufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property. **___________________________________________________________________________** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited** **Page 25 of 29** 83. In another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges that Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were *\u201cpleased to* *announce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers* *(e4Ws)\u201d* to Refex *.* As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume Gensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a disclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was withdrawn. 84. Further, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed Exchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of Rs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US Subsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. ***Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA*** 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol had come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold 1,33,48,359 shares in the Company. 86. We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. ***Prima facie*** **violations found against the Noticees** 87. In the above paragraphs, the *prima facie* findings have shown mis-utilization and diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above.

Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital **___________________________________________________________________________** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited** **Page 27 of 29** intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, *prima facie* evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests",

In view of the above, pending detailed investigation, I deem it fit to issue immediate interim directions to safeguard the interests of the investors and preserve market integrity. 95.

The investigation revealed that funds intended for electric vehicle procurement were diverted to purchase a \u20b943 crore luxury apartment in DLF's \"The Camellias\" project in Gurugram.\ue206 **Key Findings:** - **Diversion of Funds:** SEBI traced \u20b942.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF. The apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoters' mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a \u20b95 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.\ue206 - **Layered Transactions:** The funds originated from Gensol, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF. The \u20b95 crore booking advance was sourced from Gensol\u2019s funds via multiple related parties and, once refunded by DLF, rerouted to another related entity\u2014Matrix Gas and Renewables. SEBI stated that these transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds.\ue206 - **Broader Financial Misconduct:** Gensol borrowed over \u20b9977 crore from institutions like IREDA and PFC for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles but acquired only 4,704, costing \u20b9567.73 crore. Nearly \u20b9262 crore remains unaccounted for, allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities.\ue206 - **Corporate Governance Failures:** SEBI noted a complete breakdown of corporate governance at Gensol, with promoters using the company\u2019s resources for personal expenses, including purchasing luxury real estate and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol\u2019s own shares via Wellray Solar.\ue206 **Regulatory Actions:** - SEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited them, along with Gensol, from trading in the securities market.\ue206 - A planned 1:10 stock split has been frozen to protect investors.\ue206 - A forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities.\ue206 - SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.\ue206 SEBI has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.\ue206 --- For the full article and more detailed information, you can visit the original source: \ue200link\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

Even before becoming fully operational, its mere potential is already reshaping geopolitics, influencing economic strategy, and intensifying global rivalries. This article connects how this technological quantum leap is driving power shifts, deepening conflicts, and redrawing the map of the 21st century. Introduction We are living in an era of technological advancements hitherto unseen: artificial intelligence (AI) is installed on almost every smartphone, our data floats in a gigantic virtual cloud, financial assets are stored in novel, digital currencies and the list goes on and on. Recently, significant breakthroughs have been made with a technology that will be an absolute game changer \u2014 quantum computing! The first running quantum computer will mark* an inflection point as we will enter the era of quantum supremacy [1]; an era in which we can calculate problems that were previously beyond reach[2] \u2014 just as the invention of the telescope allowed us to observe galaxies we didn\u2019t even know existed, or the microscope revealed entire worlds within a drop of water. Used wisely, this technology will help us solve humanity\u2019s most pressing problems \u2014 as I argued in Part 1 of this article . However, there is a potentially dark side to these developments, as the power of the technology will upset global economic, political, military and social balances. The unfathomable computational strength of QCs will shift geopolitical power towards entities (yes, entities not necessarily nation states!) with access to QCs[3]. This will create risks that may be impossible to control as we\u2019ll learn later in this think piece. We are at an inflection point entering an era of technological supremacy, where entities that lead in innovation and have access to the most advanced technologies will set the rules for the future. Almost all new tech can be used beneficially or maliciously, think of nuclear technology and the scientist of the Manhattan project : They debated the implications of the technology they were building long before it was operational. For QC the same level of proactive ethical foresight is needed \u2014 and it is needed right now! The second part of this article will examine these emerging risks, explore their geopolitical, social and economic implications and assess how this not-yet-operational technology is already affecting international affairs. Last but not least, we\u2019ll explore what safeguards, if any, we",

Quantum Computing: Power, Peril, and the Coming Symbiosis with AI Quantum computing won\u2019t just be a technological upgrade \u2014 it will mark a decisive point: A new era will begin the moment the first operational QC becomes a reality. It will offer computational power beyond anything we can currently comprehend. What we do with that power could shape the fate of our planet \u2014 for better or for worse. QCs could become humanity\u2019s ultimate problem-solving engine. They promise breakthroughs in climate modelling, energy system optimisation, and disease prevention \u2014 enabling us to unravel some of the most stubborn and complex challenges we face today. Part 1 of this article addressed this in detail. But there\u2019s a darker side to that power. It stems largely from two extraordinary capabilities of QCs: quantum decryption and quantum simulation. Each unlocks of these unprecedented potential \u2014 and peril \u2014 across multiple domains: Quantum Decryption : A quantum computer can crack today\u2019s encryption with ease, rendering our current cryptographic safeguards obsolete. This threatens every sector that relies on secure data \u2014 banking, healthcare, communications, and national security. In practical terms, a sufficiently advanced QC could decrypt financial networks or manipulate transactions at will. That\u2019s not just a technical failure \u2014 it\u2019s a recipe for financial panic, collapse of trust, and social upheaval. Quantum Simulations : QCs will be able to model highly complex, multidimensional systems that classical computers simply can\u2019t handle. That\u2019s a good thing \u2014 until it\u2019s not. Quantum simulations could rapidly accelerate discoveries in sensitive fields like biotechnology or nanotech, pushing breakthroughs faster than society can regulate or absorb. Some experts believe these advances could become existential threats \u2014 for instance, by enabling the design of autonomous weapons or engineered pathogens before any oversight is possible. Whoever reaches quantum supremacy first will likely reach quantum dominance soon after. That actor \u2014 whether a state or non-state entity \u2014 will gain a decisive advantage across science, defence, finance, and global governance. Quantum supremacy might just determine the next global hegemon[4]. An excellent example of such a technological advantage is what happened on the Ukrainian battlefield: Ukrainian forces were able to stop the advance of an attacker who outnumbered them by using intelligence \u2014 both open source and foreign \u2014 in combination with AI ; this combination allowed them to strike the right point at the right time and leave the attackers bewildered[5]. Add the power of a quantum computer to such an approach and the results will be unfathomable; the race for this advantage is on! Google\u2019s recent Willow breakthrough \u2014 reducing computation times from 10 septillion years to minutes \u2014 has supercharged this global race. Microsoft quickly followed with claims of a new quantum state of matter. At the time of writing (March 2025), Quantinuum reported a breakthrough regarding a hitherto unsolvable mathematical problem and D-Wave even claimed quantum supremacy[6]! One thing is clear: the pace of discovery is accelerating. This isn\u2019t a coincidence, AI is now playing a major role in supporting quantum development. The animation",

AI and Quantum Computing: A Symbiotic Supercycle \u2014 This infographic illustrates the potential feedback loop between artificial intelligence and quantum computing in whcih each technology accelerates the other, potentially beyond human oversight. This infographic illustrates the growing interdependence between artificial intelligence and quantum computing \u2014 a feedback loop where each technology accelerates the other, potentially beyond human oversight. As shown in the infographic, AI is already supporting QC by assisting its operation and design. Ultimately, this won\u2019t remain a one-way street: once QCs are fully operational, they will accelerate AI development in return, while providing it with unprecedented computational power. A symbiosis that will lead to an ever-accelerating innovation cycle \u2014 one increasingly difficult for humans to govern. As we approach this threshold, we must be clear-eyed: quantum computing will usher in extraordinary opportunity \u2014 but also serious, immediate, and interlinked risks. It\u2019s time we looked at those risks in more detail. Quantum Computing\u2019s Severe Risks: Systemic and Interdependent The sci-fi technology not only comes with the outlined severe risks for both our shared socio-economic system and our very existence, but also with systemic impact. The risks however, are not posed by the computer itself but by the controlling entity and cascades of events that could be triggered if the power of QCs is not used responsibly. The visual risk matrix illustrates that a plethora of events could be initiated that could lead to adverse outcomes; these example risks are not exhaustive \u2014 they highlight how quantum technology, if misused or unleashed without safeguards, could upend society or even jeopardise our existence. In the risk matrix, hover over the outer layer depicting the potential result of QC misuse to see which QC capability \u2014 simulations or decryption \u2014 is the cause (1), which domain is impacted (2) and the result (3) including links for further reading; the buttons in the top left-hand corner allow you to explore socio-economic and existential risks separately. The Quantum Risk Matrix: An interactive overview of the systemic and existential risks posed by quantum computing. Explore by capability, affected sector, or potential outcome, hover over the outer layer to see the cascade and its results; the buttons in the top left corner allow you to explore the main risk categories. This interactive matrix visualises the dual-edged nature of quantum computing. Hover to explore how misuse of decryption or simulation capabilities can ripple through sectors and domains, triggering cascading systemic or existential crises. Notably, these threats are often synergetic, meaning they can amplify one another. The risk matrix\u2019s scenarios don\u2019t occur in isolation \u2014 they interact and cascade. For instance, a quantum-enabled attack that decrypts and collapses the financial system would inevitably trigger broader economic crisis, which potentially leads to social upheaval. Such a scenario is subsequently likely to cause a political crisis, which would affect the workings of society itself. Likewise, rapid quantum-driven advances in AI or biotechnology could emerge just as institutions are weakened by",

In short, not only do QCs pose serious risks, but the mechanisms behind the risks are interdependent and could \u2014 through cascade effects \u2014 create runaway scenarios that we may not be able to control! These risks are not theoretical \u2014 they are driving geopolitical action in real time. The race to develop the first operable quantum computer is already fuelling a full-blown global technology war, most visibly between the U.S. and China[7]. Quantum supremacy promises dominance not just in computation, but in finance, defence, and data \u2014 the pillars of modern power. This has led to geopolitical tensions and an escalating cycle of techno-strategic rivalry. The symbiosis between quantum computing and AI has only raised the stakes further \u2014 the two technologies amplify one another, raising both opportunity and risk. Owing to these high stakes, quantum computing has become the epicentre of a modern Cold War \u2014 a full-blown tech race between China and the United States[8]. It\u2019s no longer about catching up; it\u2019s about who can leap ahead fastest[9]. Technology & Geopolitics: The Quantum Arms Race Quantum computing is clearly a frontier technology: Building a functional QC requires some of the most fine-tuned physical conditions known to science: near absolute-zero temperatures, ultra-high vacuum environments, and near-perfect isolation\u2026\u2026 and that\u2019s just the hardware. Equally critical are advanced semiconductors and control systems, prerequisites for the sophisticated AI that enables the quantum chip to operate, i.e. to remain in coherence. The quantum chip requires strategic chemical elements \u2014 more on this later \u2014 and \u2014 rather unsurprisingly \u2014 serious financial assets. Due to the high stakes around QCs, governments are investing heavily in it: The heatmap below shows how nations, unions and federations around the world are stepping up, funnelling billions into the race for quantum supremacy. Some rely mainly on their private sector as well as public-private partnerships (PPPs), like the United States; some mainly on centralised investments, as for instance China or use a multi-faceted approach of like European countries that utilise national and EU-wide investment, research programmes, start-up support as well as PPPs (in the Heatmap, click EU to see national investments). When it comes to the main direct competitors, the US has the advantage of larger private sector investments and a decentralised, highly-collaborative environment of corporates, research institutions leading universities and the Pentagon\u2019s Playground for Mad Scientists (DARPA)[10]. This ecosystem is a huge advantage over China\u2019s top-down approach, in my view. Global Quantum Investments Heatmap: This heatmap reveals the global race for quantum supremacy, with strategic public investments varying in scale and structure \u2014 from China\u2019s centralised mega-funding to the U.S.\u2019s public-private innovation ecosystem. The race for quantum computing is the modern-day analogue to the nuclear arms race of the 20th century \u2014 only this time, the battleground is shifting from raw military power and control over land & resources to technological supremacy[11].

    "chunk": "Trump, has aptly dubbed this new arena \u201c techno-politics \u201d. Yet as we\u2019ll see next, control over critical resources remains a decisive factor in this escalating contest. The battle, however, is not exclusively fought with proactive measure to support QC progress, there is a flip side: next to supporting the development of the technology, players are looking for means to prohibit others from achieving quantum supremacy first. Interestingly, these efforts are key factors in ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions that we follow through the media without realising that they are linked to technological endeavours. Don\u2019t despair, I\u2019ll tie it all together later in this article. Breaking the Cycle: Chips on the Global Table While a plethora of high-tech equipment is necessary to run a QC, the real strategic Achilles heel in this race is the supply of advanced semiconductors. Quantum computers depend on sophisticated control systems, which in turn require the most advanced semiconductors; the infographic on the QC-AI symbiosis in the preceding section illustrated this. These semiconductors are produced mainly in countries affiliated with the West, and the West\u2019s plan is to achieve quantum supremacy first not only by pushing the technology, but also by prohibiting China access to the mentioned chips. Ultimately, it\u2019s precisely the symbiosis between AI and QC, the virtuous circle shown in the preceding section, that rival nations are trying to disrupt; see the animation below. Breaking the Cycle: The race for technological supremacy is not just about winning, it is also about preventing opponents from catching up. To prevent China from gaining the upper hand, the US has imposed sweeping trade restrictions , targeting not just Chinese companies but the global semiconductor supply chain. These sanctions aim to slow China\u2019s access to high-end chips \u2014 and by extension, to the advanced quantum and AI systems that depend on them. Initial sanction have been implemented during the first Trump presidency and were tightened several times since. The animation below shows semiconductor exports \u2014 from basic to advanced \u2013from the US to China, and illustrates that only the most recent restriction have had an impact, as earlier versions could be circumvented. Meanwhile, other countries have joined the allegiance to control access to state-of-the-art chips; Japan, Taiwan, the Netherlands and many other countries have joined this allegiance[12]. The Semiconductor Squeeze: This animation tracks escalating export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, spearheaded by the U.S. and its allies. These sanctions aim to block China\u2019s access to the high-performance chips essential for quantum computing and AI \u2014 in an attempt to disrupt the virtuous tech cycle and retain strategic advantage. The sanctions, however, had a fair few unintended consequences such as spurring China\u2019s domestic endeavours for advanced chip manufacturing, the hoarding of chips and equipment or the establishment of back-channel supply chains. In addition, the restrictions are obviously hampering innovation by disrupting the global innovation eco-system; since countries that are not clearly affiliated with the West are included in export restrictions, innovations from their end are hampered leading to a slowdown of development[13]. The most important & detrimental knock-on effect, however, is",

    "chunk": "the resurgence of an old conflict in East Asia: China\u2019s territorial ambitions regarding Taiwan! The Strait of Taiwan has become a geopolitical flashpoint again: Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor foundries (especially TSMC) are among the few capable of producing the chips needed to control next-gen QCs. In strategic terms, this makes Taiwan not just a territorial prize, but a technological one \u2014 protected, for now, by what\u2019s often referred to as the Silicon Shield . Should China lay its hands on the Island nation, the West \u2014 led by the United States \u2014 would clearly intervene, hence Taiwan\u2019s capabilities in silicon chip manufacturing are attraction and deterrent at the same time, providing Taiwan with its Silicon Shield[14]. The recent developments in the Strait of Taiwan clearly show that both sides are flexing muscles[15]. China is continuing military drills, most recently resembling a blockade of the Island, while Western countries are sending naval forces to indicate their likely response[16]. From this it can be seen that the stakes in this race are very, very high. Intelligence services are also on the case: Taiwan\u2019s counterintelligence was able to catch four soldiers working in the presidential office who were spying for China and is tracking a large scale attempt to recruit Taiwanese tech personnel for Chinese endeavours[17]. Still, China has its assets as well: it controls another vital ingredient for high tech, and it didn\u2019t take long for China to use it in retaliation. Let\u2019s take a closer look at this below. China\u2019s Tit-forTat: Critical Mineral Resources High-tech is a lot about know-how, but not exclusively; some chemical elements are irreplaceable in the manufacturing of advanced systems such as platinum for catalysis or neodymium for state-of-the-art magnets. A group of chemical elements referred to as rare earth metals (REMs) are critical for a range of important tech developments including electric engines, LED lights, fibre-optic cables and state-of-the-art magnets. In defense, REMs are used in satellite communications, guidance systems, and aircraft structures. The U.S. Department of Defense has highlighted the importance of securing a stable supply of these materials, noting their use in critical defence capabilities such as the F-35 Lightning II aircraft and advanced radar systems[18]. In addition to these important applications, REMs are critical for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 quantum chips . Currently, the main producer of these elements is China and it did not wait long to use its control over this resource to retaliate the US\u2019 export bans with an analogue for REMs[19]. In December 2023, China banned the export of technology related to rare earth magnet production, adding to existing restrictions on extraction and separation technologies. These measures underscore China\u2019s intent to maintain its dominance in the rare earth sector, as it accounts for nearly 90% of global refined output[20]. This strategic move underscores the pivotal role REMs play not only in quantum computing but also across a spectrum of high-tech applications, including defence systems[21]. China\u2019s export controls on REMs have prompted other nations to seek alternative sources and reduce reliance on Chinese supplies[22]. For example, the European Union has announced strategic projects",

Equally, the United States are exploring domestic resources, such as the Round Top Mountain in Texas, which hosts significant deposits of heavy rare-earth elements[24]. The geopolitical manoeuvring surrounding REMs highlights their strategic importance in the global technology landscape. As nations vie for technological supremacy, control over these critical materials has become a focal point, influencing trade policies, international relations and most importantly conflicts. The key here is the geographical distribution of REMs and how this distribution overlaps with political allegiances, the infographic below explains this, please click yourself through it. Geopolitics of Rare Earth Metals: An interactive infographic that shows the distribution of REMs by country and allegiance. From the above infographic you can see that REMs are concentrated in a few countries and the lion\u2019s share of REMs are in countries with a BRICS affiliation! Hence, the West\u2019s access is limited and the global contest for REMs has intensified through the advent of quantum computing, with geopolitical tensions influencing strategic manoeuvres. From the infographic, you clearly recognised two countries that have been in the media quite a lot lately: Ukraine and Greenland. To understand how REMs are reshaping alliances, let\u2019s examine these two geopolitical flashpoint. In the midst of the Ukraine conflict, President Donald Trump, shortly after taking office, demanded compensation from Ukraine for the extensive military aid the US had provided to the attacked country. \u201cSurprisingly\u201d, this compensation was to be paid in the form of an agreement on critical minerals, including \u2014 you guessed it again \u2014 rare earth metals. The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to agree on such an arrangement but insists on tying it to security guarantees for his country, while his US counterpart is reluctant and is pressuring Ukraine. We\u2019re not in checkmate, but definitely in check. President Selensky has \u2014 in my opinion quite rightly \u2014 turned Trump\u2019s deal down as it did not come with security guarantees; he owes it to the Ukrainian people to make the most of the countries resources and use them as a shield analogue to Taiwan\u2019s silicon shield. An indirect safeguard for Ukraine, however, would be American \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in form of US mining giants exploring resources in Ukraine \u2014 I bet Russia would think twice or thrice about bombing Ukraine if this would interfere with US business operations regarding strategic resources. The tricky part, Ukraine\u2019s REM deposits are mainly located in areas currently held by Russia[25] and the American president has initiated parallel talks with the Kremlin regarding resource production[26]. Mr Trump is driving a hard bargain here, well realising that he is playing with European security. Concurrently, Trump has renewed his interest in acquiring Greenland, citing its vast reserves of rare earth elements and it strategic location for entrance into the Atlantic ocean as vital for U.S. national security. These developments underscore the escalating global scramble for REMs, driven by their indispensable role in high-tech industries and defence applications. Nota bene : these conflicts and",

Moreover, Ukraine\u2019s REM reserves are disputed by many citing that estimates hail back to Soviet assessments that are hardly reliable[27]; meanwhile, however, intelligence services use satellite-based remote sensing data as well as aerial magnetic and radiometric surveys that seem to tell a different story[28]. Let\u2019s face facts: We live in a time in which publicly disclosed data is meant to steer rather than to inform! The state of play regarding Ukraine\u2019s REM reserves will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming article. The above explained examples show that \u2014 behind Trump\u2019s bold and populist rhetoric \u2014 there are strategic goals aimed at cementing the US\u2019s position as a technological and military leader, as well as re-establishing the US as a global economic powerhouse. The economy is another factor driving interest in QC; in the following sections, we\u2019ll explore what experts think about the potential for positive economic impact that QC can provide. The Economic Promise of Quantum Computing Still, the hype around QCs isn\u2019t just geopolitical, the economics of the tech look pretty nice too. According to leading consultancies and market analysts, quantum computing could generate between $450 billion and $2 trillion in economic value by 2035. That\u2019s not just a futuristic vision \u2014 it\u2019s a near-term transformation! As visualised in the infographic below, estimates vary widely depending on how quickly the technology matures and how broadly it\u2019s adopted. The Boston Consulting Group provides a conservative range of $450\u2013850 billion, while Quantum Insider and McKinsey & Company both project potential impacts approaching or exceeding $1 trillion. That\u2019s a market larger than the entire global smartphone ecosystem today. But these forecasts don\u2019t only reflect the growth of hardware and software sales \u2014 they account for value creation across sectors: pharma, logistics, finance, energy, materials science, and beyond. Quantum computing won\u2019t just launch a new tech vertical \u2014 it will upgrade existing ones. In the short term, the market for quantum hardware and software alone is expected to hit $8\u201315 billion by 2025, underscoring the urgency with which industry leaders are building quantum capacity. As the timeline narrows, the stakes rise \u2014 not just for businesses and investors, but for entire economies competing to capture the lion\u2019s share of this transformative value. Quantum\u2019 Computing\u2019s Economic Horizon: Graphic exploring different projections for the economic value added by QC (left) and the market size of QC itself. The economic impact of quantum computing will also depend on how the technology \u2014 and its symbiosis with AI \u2014 will be managed by government. From the risk assessment, it can be clearly seen that we cannot let this technologies \u201cgo loose\u201d as there are too many risks involved. Legislators will have to face the difficult balancing act of supporting this innovation while safeguarding the public interest, an important point that we\u2019ll explore together hereafter.

    "chunk": "its most dangerous consequences. Governments, research institutions, and industry coalitions are scrambling to future-proof digital systems and strategic infrastructure before quantum capabilities render them obsolete \u2014 or dangerously vulnerable[29]. Below are key pillars of this evolving security architecture. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): The most urgent safeguard is building encryption that quantum computers can\u2019t break. Known as post-quantum cryptography, or PQC, this new class of encryption algorithms is designed to withstand attacks from quantum decryption. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized its first set of PQC standards and published a roadmap for retiring RSA and ECC encryption by 2035 \u2014 a shift already echoed by France\u2019s phased transition strategy targeting full PQC compliance by 2030. Several countries, including Germany, Canada, and Japan, are running parallel efforts to ensure their critical infrastructure and digital assets can survive in a post-quantum world[30]. Quantum Security Guidelines & Crypto-Agility: The ability to adapt encryption systems swiftly \u2014 known as crypto-agility \u2014 is becoming a regulatory priority[31]. Singapore\u2019s Cyber Security Agency (CSA) will roll out national guidelines in 2025 to guide institutions through risk-based assessments, focusing on data value and migration timelines. Meanwhile, frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) already require state-of-the-art encryption, nudging institutions toward hybrid cryptographic models that blend classical and quantum-safe algorithms. National Security Initiatives: Quantum tech is now a tier-one national security issue. Intelligence agencies and military planners are actively assessing how future QCs could compromise classified communications, weapons systems, and power grids[32]. As a result, national initiatives are being funded at scale to: Harden communications infrastructure with quantum-resistant protocols. Map vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure under quantum threat models. Develop counterintelligence strategies to deter hostile use of quantum capabilities. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): Alongside PQC, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is gaining traction as a complementary technology. By using principles of quantum mechanics, QKD allows two parties to establish encryption keys that are theoretically tamper-proof. Organisations are beginning phased QKD deployment \u2014 starting with highly sensitive communication networks before expanding to wider IT ecosystems. Strategic Workforce Development & Supply Chain Resilience: The OECD has flagged two immediate bottlenecks to secure quantum adoption: people and materials. Nations are boosting investment in STEM education, research fellowships, and vocational training to fill the global shortage of quantum-literate engineers and scientists. Meanwhile, policymakers are monitoring dependencies on critical resources like rare earth elements and cryogenic materials to safeguard the quantum hardware supply chain. Financial Sector Safeguards: Quantum decryption would hit finance first \u2014 and hardest. Recognising this, the G7 Cyber Expert Group has issued quantum-readiness guidelines to financial institutions, recommending tailored risk assessments and resilience strategies built around quantum-safe standards. Central banks are now including quantum threats in scenario analyses for systemic risk planning. Digital Diplomacy & Strategic Alliances: Quantum security isn\u2019t just a technical challenge \u2014 it\u2019s a diplomatic one. Nations are beginning to formalise \u201cdigital diplomacy\u201d frameworks: cross-border agreements on tech standards, export controls, and joint research initiatives. The EU, U.S., and Japan are leading the charge in forming such alliances, often tied to existing cybersecurity pacts or 6G research",

    "chunk": "partnerships. The Quad Alliance (U.S., India, Australia, Japan) has also discussed quantum as a critical area of cooperation. These initiatives aim not only to set shared guardrails, but also to prevent misuse of dual-use technologies and ensure equitable access. Transition Timelines & Compliance Frameworks: Migration to quantum-safe systems will not happen overnight. Most roadmaps, such as those from NIST and ANSSI (France\u2019s cybersecurity agency), stretch into the 2030s. As critical sectors \u2014 finance, telecom, healthcare, automotive \u2014 prepare to overhaul their security stacks, governments are establishing transition frameworks to support coordinated compliance and avoid market fragmentation. Despite encouraging momentum, several hurdles remain: The cost of implementing quantum-safe infrastructure could be prohibitive for SMEs. The current concentration of quantum talent and infrastructure in a few wealthy nations risks exacerbating global inequalities. Vulnerabilities in rare-earth supply chains could delay hardware deployment, especially in lower-income or geopolitically isolated regions. As the technology curve steepens, regulators will have to walk a tightrope \u2014 balancing innovation and competitiveness on the one hand, with national security, individual rights, and global equity on the other. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: securing the digital world before QCs arrive will be one of the most consequential policy challenges of our time. A Geopolitical Wake-Up Call! Beyond the scramble for tech supremacy, recent developments should serve as a broader wake-up call. The days of near-automatic security guarantees from the United States are waning. US President Trump\u2019s quid-pro-quo stance on military aid has made clear that NATO countries must fulfil their commitments, including the long-standing obligation to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence. In Brussels, there is a long-overdue rethink: energy and defence security are climbing back to the top of the agenda. Europe must now take responsibility \u2014 not only to defend its nations and Union, but also to preserve peace and order on its own continent. In my view, this can only be achieved through deterrence. Si vis pacem, para bellum. But this imperative extends far beyond European borders. The international order itself is becoming increasingly unstable. Should Ukraine fall, it would set a precedent that encourages aggression elsewhere. Taiwan, already under pressure, could become the next flashpoint. In a world where technological supremacy determines economic and strategic power, the loss of Taiwan would not just be territorial \u2014 it would mark a tectonic shift in tech capabilities and hence in global influence. As shown in this article, the race for quantum computing and AI will determine who sets the rules in defence, trade, communication, and governance. That is why upholding the sovereignty of nations like Ukraine is not just a moral duty \u2014 it is a geopolitical necessity. The international community has to make it clear \u2014 once and for all \u2014 that borders agreed under international law have to be respected no matter what! Moreover, we must recognise that the world has become more fragile over the past years \u2014 politically, economically, and environmentally. Technology now acts as both an accelerator and a disruptor. Rapid advances in AI, quantum computing, and biotech can provide power almost overnight.",

    "chunk": "As such, the global balance of power is becoming more fluid than ever. But when power shifts continuously and unpredictably, it becomes harder to establish new equilibriums \u2014 and easier for chaos to emerge. That chaos is not abstract: history teaches us that social instability and economic asymmetries often lead to conflict. The roaring 1920s brought enormous economic and technological progress to Europe \u2014 but also amplified social inequalities and thus set the stage for the (geo-)political breakdown that followed. We would do well to remember that. In short, in a world where technology shifts faster than diplomacy or governance, the burden of maintaining peace will fall increasingly on the shoulders of responsible nations. We must be ready to carry it. Conclusions Quantum computing is not just another tech wave \u2014 it\u2019s the tide that may redraw the contours of global power itself. The actor \u2014 be it a state, a corporation, or a coalition \u2014 that first builds a scalable, operational quantum computer won\u2019t just achieve a leap in processing power; it will gain the strategic upper hand across finance, defence, science, and governance. Technological edge will translate directly into geopolitical dominance. That\u2019s why the race for quantum supremacy is being fought on multiple fronts \u2014 from chip embargoes to rare earth mineral deals, from research alliances to export controls and from using military power to intelligence interventions. It also explains why former President Trump has placed quantum computing at the top of his strategic agenda: not just through bold statements and high-level appointments, but by redrawing international alliances around critical technology assets. But this goes far beyond any one leader or administration. We are witnessing the emergence of a new global order \u2014 one no longer defined by borders, oil fields or military bases, but by who controls the next era of computation. The question is no longer if quantum computing will arrive. It\u2019s when \u2014 and more crucially, on whose terms. Will we harness this power to solve our shared global challenges? Or will we allow it to deepen divisions and fuel a new era of techno-political instability? The inflection point is approaching. The consequences will be profound. But the direction it takes is still \u2014 for now \u2014 in our hands.

We\u2019ll start by breaking down the basics of knowledge graphs and their role in RAG. We\u2019ll compare these to vector databases and learn when it's best to use one or the other. Then, we\u2019ll get hands-on to create a knowledge graph from text data, store it in a database, and use it to find relevant info for user queries. We\u2019ll also look at expanding this approach to handle different types of data and file formats beyond just plain text. If you want to learn more about RAG, check out this article on **[retrieval augmented](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)** **[generation.](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)** ## **What Is a Knowledge Graph?** Knowledge graphs represent information in a structured, interconnected format. They consist of entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) between those entities. Entities can represent real-world objects, concepts, or ideas, while relationships describe how those entities are connected. The intuition behind knowledge graphs is to mimic the way humans understand and reason about the world. We don't store information in isolated silos; instead, we make connections between different pieces of information, forming a rich, interconnected web of knowledge. Knowledge graphs help us see how entities are connected by clearly showing the relationships between different entities. Exploring these connections allows us to find new information and make conclusions that would be hard to draw from separate pieces of information. Let\u2019s look at an example. https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 1/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} Figure 1: In this visual representation, the nodes are shown as circles, and the relationships are represented as labeled arrows connecting the nodes. This knowledge graph effectively captures the employment relationships between the individuals Sarah and Michael and the company prismaticAI. In our example, we have three nodes: **Node** **1** Type: Person Name: Sarah **Node 2** Type: Person Name: Michael **Node 3** Type: Company Name: prismaticAI In sum, we have two person nodes (Sarah and Michael) and one company node (prismaticAI). Now, let's look at the relationships (edges) between these nodes: **Relationship 1** : Sarah --[works for]-->",

    "chunk": "prismaticAI This relationship indicates that Sarah, represented by Node 1, has a \"works for\" relationship with prismaticAI, represented by Node 3. In other words, Sarah is an employee of prismaticAI. **Relationship 2** : Michael --[works for]--> prismaticAI Similar to the first relationship, this one shows that Michael, represented by Node 2, also has a \"works for\" relationship with prismaticAI (Node 3). Michael is an employee of prismaticAI as well. **Querying and traversing knowledge graphs** One of the powerful aspects of knowledge graphs is the ability to query and traverse the relationships between entities to extract relevant information or infer new knowledge. Let's explore how we can do this with our example knowledge graph. First, we need to determine what information we want to retrieve from the knowledge graph. For example: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 2/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp **Query 1** : Where does Sarah work? To answer the query, we need to find the appropriate starting point in the knowledge graph. In this case, we want to start from the node representing Sarah. From the starting point (Sarah's node), we follow the outgoing \"works for\" relationship edge. This edge connects Sarah's node to the node representing prismaticAI. By traversing the \"works for\" relationship, we can conclude that Sarah works for prismaticAI. **Answer 1:** Sarah works for prismaticAI. Let's try another query: **Query 2** : Who works for prismaticAI? This time, we want to start from the node representing prismaticAI. From the prismaticAI node, we follow the \"works for\" relationship edges backward. This will lead us to the nodes representing the people who work for prismaticAI. By traversing the \"works for\" relationships in reverse, we can identify that both Sarah and Michael work for prismaticAI. **Answer 2** : Sarah and Michael work for prismaticAI. One more example! **Query 3** : Does Michael work for the same company as Sarah? We can start from either Sarah's node or Michael's node. Let's start from Sarah's node. We follow the \"works for\" relationship to reach the prismaticAI node. Then, we check if Michael also has a \"works for\" relationship leading to the same prismaticAI node. Since both Sarah and Michael have a \"works for\" relationship with the prismaticAI node, we can conclude that they work for the same company. **Answer 3** : Yes, Michael works for the same company as Sarah (prismaticAI). Traversing the relationships in the knowledge graph allows us to extract specific pieces of information and understand the connections between entities. Knowledge graphs can become much more complex, with numerous nodes and relationships, allowing for the representation of intricate real-world knowledge in a structured and interconnected way. ## **Benefits of Knowledge Graphs in RAG Applications** RAG applications combine information retrieval and natural language generation to provide relevant and coherent responses to user queries or prompts. Knowledge graphs offer several advantages that make them particularly well-suited for these applications. Let's dive into the key benefits: **Structured knowledge representation** As we learned in the previous section, knowledge graphs represent information in a structured manner, with entities (nodes) and their",

    "source_type": "pdf",
    "chunk": "relationships (edges). This structured representation makes it easier to retrieve relevant information for a given query or task, compared to unstructured text data. In our example knowledge graph, we can easily retrieve information about who works for prismaticAI by following the \"works for\" relationships. **Contextual understanding** Knowledge graphs capture the relationships between entities, enabling a deeper understanding of the context in which information is presented. This contextual understanding is crucial for generating coherent and relevant responses in RAG applications. Back to our example, understanding the \"works for\" relationship between Sarah, Michael, and prismaticAI, would allow a RAG application to provide more contextually relevant responses about their employment. **Inferential reasoning** Traversing the relationships in a knowledge graph allows RAG applications to make inferences and derive new knowledge that may not be explicitly stated. This inferential https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 3/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp reasoning capability improves the quality and completeness of the generated responses. By traversing the relationships, a RAG application can infer that Sarah and Michael work for the same company, even if this information is not directly stated. **Knowledge integration** Knowledge graphs can integrate information from multiple sources, allowing RAG applications to use diverse and complementary knowledge bases. This integration of knowledge can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded responses. We could add information about companies, employees, and their roles from various sources to our knowledge graph example, providing a more complete picture for generating responses. **Explainability and transparency** Knowledge graphs provide a transparent representation of the knowledge used in generating responses. This transparency is key for explaining the reasoning behind the generated output, which is important in many applications, such as question-answering systems. The explanation for answer 3 in our example could be: Yes, Michael works for the same company as Sarah. I arrived at this conclusion by identifying that Sarah works for prismaticAI and then verifying that Michael also has a 'works for' relationship with prismaticAI. Since they both have this relationship with the same company entity, I can infer that they work for the same company. This transparency in the reasoning process allows users and developers to understand how the RAG application arrived at its response rather than treating it as a black box. It also increases trust in the system, as the decision-making process is clearly laid out and can be verified against the knowledge graph. Also, if there are any inconsistencies or missing information in the knowledge graph, the explanation can help identify and address those issues, leading to improved accuracy and completeness of the responses. Using knowledge graphs, RAG applications can create more accurate, clear, and understandable responses. This makes them useful for different tasks in natural language processing. ## **Knowledge Graphs Vs. Vector Databases** When building RAG applications, you may encounter two different approaches: knowledge graphs and vector databases. While both are used for representing and retrieving information, they differ in their underlying data structures and the way they handle information. Let's explore the key differences between these two approaches: **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model",

Knowledge graphs excel at representing and reasoning over structured knowledge, while vector databases are well-suited for tasks that rely heavily on semantic similarity and information retrieval based on vector representations. You can learn more about vector databases in this **[introduction to vector databases for](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-vector-databases-for-machine-learning)** **[machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-vector-databases-for-machine-learning)** . Additionally, see the **[five most popular vector databases](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/the-top-5-vector-databases)** . ## **How to Implement Knowledge Graphs for RAG** **Applications** In this section, we'll explore how to implement a knowledge graph to augment the language generation process for RAG application. We'll cover the following key steps: Loading and preprocessing text data. Initializing a language model and extracting a knowledge graph. Storing the knowledge graph in a database for persistence and querying. Retrieving relevant knowledge from the graph based on user queries. Generating responses by synthesizing the retrieved knowledge with the language model. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of implementing knowledge graphs in RAG applications, enabling you to build more intelligent and context-aware language generation systems. **Prerequisites** Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed: Python 3.7 or higher LangChain library ( `pip install langchain` ) LlamaIndex library ( `pip install llama-index` ) Neo4j database (or any other compatible graph database) **Step 1: Load and preprocess text data** The first step is to load and preprocess the text data from which we'll extract the knowledge graph. In this example, we'll use a text snippet describing a technology company called https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 5/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp prismaticAI, its employees, and their roles. ``` from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter # Load text data text = \"\"\"Sarah is an employee at prismaticAI, a leading technology company based Michael is also an employee at prismaticAI, where he works as a data scientist. H prismaticAI is a well-known technology company that specializes in developing cut Both Sarah and Michael are highly skilled professionals who contribute significan loader = TextLoader(text) documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=20) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) ``` **[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)** We start by importing the necessary classes from LangChain: TextLoader and CharacterTextSplitter . TextLoader loads the text data, while CharacterTextSplitter splits the text into smaller chunks for more efficient processing. Next, we define the text data as a multi-line string variable text . We then use TextLoader to load the text data directly from the text variable. The loader.load() method returns a list of Document objects, each containing a chunk of the text. To split the text into smaller, more manageable chunks, we create an instance of CharacterTextSplitter with a chunk_size of 200 characters and a chunk_overlap of 20 characters. The chunk_overlap parameter ensures that there",

    "chunk": "is some overlap between adjacent chunks, which can be helpful for maintaining context during the knowledge extraction process. Finally, we use the split_documents method of CharacterTextSplitter to split the Document objects into smaller chunks, which are stored in the texts variable as a list of Document objects. Preprocessing the text data in this way allows us to prepare it for the next step, where we'll initialize a language model and use it to extract a knowledge graph from the text chunks. **Step 2: Initialize language model and extract knowledge graph** After loading and preprocessing the text data, the next step is to initialize a language model and use it to extract a knowledge graph from the text chunks. In this example, we'll be using the OpenAI language model provided by LangChain. ``` from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.transformers import LLMGraphTransformer import getpass import os # Load environment variable for OpenAI API key os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass() # Initialize LLM llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Extract Knowledge Graph llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm) graph_documents = llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(texts) ``` **[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)** First, we import the necessary classes from LangChain: OpenAI and LLMGraphTransformer . OpenAI is a wrapper for the OpenAI language model, which we'll use to extract the knowledge graph. LLMGraphTransformer is a utility class that helps convert text data into a knowledge graph representation. https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 6/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp Next, we load the OpenAI API key from an environment variable. This is a security best practice to avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials in your code. We then initialize an instance of the OpenAI language model with a temperature of 0 . The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the model's output, with lower values producing more deterministic responses. After initializing the language model, we create an instance of LLMGraphTransformer and pass the initialized llm object to it. The LLMGraphTransformer class converts the text chunks ( texts ) into a knowledge graph representation. Finally, we call the convert_to_graph_documents method of LLMGraphTransformer, passing in the texts list. This method uses the language model to analyze the text chunks and extract relevant entities, relationships, and other structured information, which are then represented as a knowledge graph. The resulting knowledge graph is stored in the graph_documents variable. We have successfully initialized a language model and used it to extract a knowledge graph from the text data. In the next step, we\u2019ll store the knowledge graph in a database for persistence and querying. **Step 3: Store knowledge graph in a database** After extracting the knowledge graph from the text data, it's important to store it in a persistent and queryable format. In this tutorial, we'll use Neo4j to store the knowledge graph. ``` from langchain.graph_stores import Neo4jGraphStore # Store Knowledge Graph in Neo4j graph_store = Neo4jGraphStore(url=\"neo4j://your_neo4j_url\", username=\"your_userna graph_store.write_graph(graph_documents) ``` **[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)** First, we import the Neo4jGraphStore class from LangChain. This class provides a convenient interface for interacting with a Neo4j database and storing knowledge graphs. Next, we create an instance of Neo4jGraphStore by providing the necessary",

    "chunk": "connection details: the Neo4j database URL, username, and password. Make sure to replace \"your_neo4j_url\", \"your_username\", and \"your_password\" with the appropriate values for your Neo4j instance. Finally, we call the write_graph method of the graph_store instance, passing in the graph_documents list obtained from the previous step. This method serializes the knowledge graph and writes it to the Neo4j database. Storing the knowledge graph in a Neo4j database allows us to ensure that it\u2019s persistent and can be easily queried and retrieved when needed. The graph structure of Neo4j allows for efficient representation and traversal of the complex relationships and entities present in the knowledge graph. In the next step, we'll set up the components for retrieving knowledge from the graph and generating responses using the retrieved context. It's important to note that while this tutorial uses Neo4j as the graph database, LangChain supports other graph databases as well, such as Amazon Neptune and TinkerPop compatible databases like Gremlin Server. You can swap out the Neo4jGraphStore with the appropriate graph store implementation for your chosen database. **Step 4: Retrieve knowledge for RAG** Now that we have stored the knowledge graph in a database, we can set up the components for retrieving relevant knowledge from the graph based on user queries and generating responses using the retrieved context. This is the core functionality of a RAG application. ``` from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine from llama_index.core.retrievers import KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever from llama_index.core.response_synthesis import ResponseSynthesizer ``` https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 7/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp ``` # Retrieve Knowledge for RAG graph_rag_retriever = KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever(storage_context=graph_store.stor query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(graph_rag_retriever) ``` **[POW E RE D B Y](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab)** First, we import the necessary classes from LlamaIndex: RetrieverQueryEngine, KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever, and ResponseSynthesizer . RetrieverQueryEngine is a query engine that uses a retriever to fetch relevant context from a data source (in our case, the knowledge graph) and then synthesizes a response using that context. KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever is a specialized retriever that can retrieve relevant information from a knowledge graph stored in a database. ResponseSynthesizer is responsible for generating a final response by combining the retrieved context with a language model. Next, we create an instance of KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever by passing in the storage_context from our graph_store instance. This storage_context contains the necessary information to connect to and query the Neo4j database, where we stored the knowledge graph. We also set verbose=True to enable detailed logging during the retrieval process. Then, we initialize a RetrieverQueryEngine using the from_args method and passing in our graph_rag_retriever instance. This query engine will handle the entire process of retrieving relevant context from the knowledge graph and generating a response based on that context. With these components set up, we are now ready to query the knowledge graph and generate responses using the retrieved context. In the next step, we'll see how to do this in practice. **Step 5: Query the knowledge graph and generate a response** Finally, we can query the knowledge graph and generate responses using the retrieved context. ``` def query_and_synthesize(query): retrieved_context = query_engine.query(query) response = response_synthesizer.synthesize(query, retrieved_context) print(f\"Query: {query}\") print(f\"Answer: {response}/n\") # Initialize the",

For each query, we use the query_engine to retrieve the relevant context from the knowledge graph, create an instance of ResponseSynthesizer, and call its synthesize method with the query and retrieved context. The ResponseSynthesizer uses the language model and the retrieved context to generate a final response to the query, which is then printed to the console, matching the answers in the first section of this article. ## **Knowledge Graphs in Real-world Scenarios** https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 8/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp While the tutorial demonstrates using a knowledge graph for RAG applications with relatively simple text, real-world scenarios often involve more complex and diverse data sets. Additionally, the input data may come in various file formats beyond plain text. In this section, we'll explore how the knowledge graph-based RAG application can be extended to handle such scenarios. **Handling large and diverse data sets** As the size and complexity of the input data increase, the knowledge graph extraction process may become more challenging. Here are some strategies to handle large and diverse data sets: **Distributed knowledge graph construction** : For very large data sets, the knowledge graph construction process can be parallelized and distributed across multiple machines or a cluster. This can be achieved by partitioning the data set and extracting knowledge graphs in parallel, which can then be merged into a single, unified knowledge graph. **Incremental knowledge graph updates** : Instead of rebuilding the entire knowledge graph from scratch whenever new data becomes available, an incremental approach can be adopted. This involves updating the existing knowledge graph with new information while preserving the existing knowledge and relationships. **Domain-specific knowledge graph extraction** : For data sets spanning multiple domains or topics, it may be beneficial to develop domain-specific knowledge graph extraction pipelines. These pipelines can be tailored to the terminology, entities, and relationships relevant to each domain, improving the accuracy and completeness of the extracted knowledge graphs. **Knowledge graph fusion and integration** : When working with data from multiple sources, the extracted knowledge graphs may need to be fused or integrated into a unified representation. This can involve techniques such as entity resolution, relationship alignment, and conflict resolution to ensure consistency and avoid redundancy. **Handling different file types** In real-world scenarios, data can come in various file formats, such as PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets, or even structured data formats like JSON or XML. To handle these different file types, you can use the following strategies: **File conversion:** Many libraries and tools are available to convert different file formats into plain text. For example, you can use libraries like pdfplumber or tika to extract text from PDF files or python-docx to extract text from Word documents. **Custom file loaders**",

    "chunk": ": LangChain provides a DocumentLoader interface that allows you to create custom loaders for specific file types. You can implement your own loader by subclassing DocumentLoader and overriding the load method to handle the desired file format. **Structured data handling:** For structured data formats like JSON or XML, you can use libraries like pandas or lxml to parse and extract the relevant information before passing it to the knowledge graph extraction pipeline. **Multimodal knowledge graph extraction** : In some cases, the input data may be multimodal, containing both text and other modalities like images or videos. In such scenarios, you can explore techniques for multimodal knowledge graph extraction, which combines text-based extraction with computer vision or other modality-specific methods. These strategies will help you extend the knowledge graph-based RAG application to handle more complex and diverse data sets, as well as a wider range of file types. It's important to note that as the complexity of the input data increases, the knowledge graph extraction process may require more domain-specific customization and tuning to ensure accurate and reliable results. ## **Challenges** Setting up knowledge graphs for RAG applications in the real world can be a complex task with several challenges. Let\u2019s explore some of them: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid=\u2026 9/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp **Knowledge graph construction** Building a high-quality knowledge graph is a complex and time-consuming process that requires significant domain expertise and effort. Extracting entities, relationships, and facts from various data sources and integrating them into a coherent knowledge graph can be challenging, especially for large and diverse datasets. It involves understanding the domain, identifying relevant information, and structuring it in a way that accurately captures the relationships and semantics. **Data integration and interoperability** RAG applications often need to integrate data from multiple heterogeneous sources, each with its own structure, format, and semantics. Ensuring data consistency, resolving conflicts, and mapping entities and relationships across different data sources is non-trivial. It requires careful data cleaning, transformation, and mapping to ensure that the knowledge graph accurately represents the information from various sources. **Knowledge graph maintenance and evolution** Knowledge graphs are not static. They need to be continuously updated and maintained as new information becomes available or existing information changes. Keeping the knowledge graph up-to-date and consistent with the evolving data sources can be a resource-intensive process. It involves monitoring changes in the data sources, identifying relevant updates, and propagating those updates to the knowledge graph while maintaining its integrity and consistency. **Scalability and performance** As the knowledge graph grows in size and complexity, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of the graph data becomes increasingly challenging. Scalability and performance issues can arise, particularly for large-scale RAG applications with high query volumes. Optimizing the knowledge graph storage, indexing, and query processing techniques becomes crucial to maintaining acceptable performance levels. **Query complexity and reasoning** While knowledge graphs excel at representing complex relationships and enabling multi-hop reasoning, formulating and executing complex queries that leverage these capabilities can be difficult. Developing efficient query processing and reasoning algorithms is an active area",

Understanding the knowledge graph system's query language and reasoning capabilities is important to effectively utilize its full potential. **Lack of standardization** There is a lack of widely adopted standards for representing and querying knowledge graphs, which can lead to interoperability issues and vendor lock-in. Different knowledge graph systems may use different data models, query languages, and APIs, making it challenging to switch between them or integrate with other systems. Adopting or developing standards can facilitate interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in. **Explainability and transparency** While knowledge graphs can provide explainable and transparent reasoning, ensuring that the reasoning process is easily interpretable and understandable to end-users can be a challenge, especially for complex queries or reasoning paths. Developing user-friendly interfaces and explanations that clearly communicate the reasoning process and its underlying assumptions is important for user trust and adoption. **Domain-specific challenges** Depending on the domain and application, there may be additional challenges specific to that domain, such as handling domain-specific terminology, ontologies, or data formats. For example, in the medical domain, dealing with complex medical terminologies, coding systems, and privacy concerns can add additional layers of complexity to the knowledge graph setup and usage. Despite these challenges, knowledge graphs offer significant advantages for RAG applications, particularly in terms of representing structured knowledge, enabling complex reasoning, and providing explainable and transparent results. Addressing these challenges through careful knowledge graph design, data integration strategies, and efficient query processing techniques is crucial for successfully implementing knowledge graph-based RAG applications. https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720821&utm_adgroupid\u2026 10/15 18/05/2025, 01:00 Using a Knowledge Graph to Implement a RAG Application | DataCamp ## **Conclusion** In this tutorial, we explored the power of knowledge graphs to create more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant responses. We started by understanding the fundamental concepts behind knowledge graphs and their role in RAG applications. Then, we walked through a hands-on example, extracting a knowledge graph from text data, storing it in a Neo4j database, and using it to retrieve relevant context for user queries. Finally, we demonstrated how to use the retrieved context to generate responses using the structured knowledge in the graph.

Whether you are refining a model\u2019s accuracy through fine-tuning or enhancing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system\u2019s contextual relevancy, understanding how to develop and decide on the appropriate set of LLM evaluation metrics for your use case is imperative to building a bulletproof LLM evaluation pipeline. This article will teach you everything you need to know about LLM evaluation metrics, with code samples included. We\u2019ll dive into: **What are LLM evaluation metrics**, how they can be used to evaluate LLM systems, common pitfalls, and what makes great LLM evaluation metrics great.- All the different methods for scoring LLM evaluation metrics **,**and why LLM-as-a-judge is the best for LLM evaluation. **How to build**deterministic, decision-based LLM metrics, using LLM-as-a-judge.**How to choose**your set of metrics based on your use case and LLM system implementation**How to implement**and decide on the appropriate set of LLM evaluation metrics to use in code using DeepEval (\u2b50https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval). Are you ready for the long list? Let\u2019s begin. *(Update: If you're looking for metrics to evaluate LLM chatbots/conversations, check out **this new article**)* ## What are LLM Evaluation Metrics? LLM evaluation metrics such as answer correctness, semantic similarity, and hallucination, are metrics that score an LLM system's output based on criteria you care about. They are critical to LLM evaluation, as they help quantify the performance of different LLM systems, **which can just be the LLM itself.** **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} Here are the most important and common metrics that you will likely need before launching your LLM system into production: **Answer Relevancy:**Determines whether an LLM output is able to address the given input in an informative and concise manner.**Task Completion:**Determines whether an LLM agent is able to complete the task it was set out to do.**Correctness:**Determines whether an LLM output is factually correct based on some ground truth.**Hallucination:**Determines whether an LLM output contains fake or made-up information.**Tool Correctness:**Determines whether an LLM agent is able to call the correct tools for a given task.**Contextual Relevancy:**Determines whether the retriever in a RAG-based LLM system is able to extract the most relevant information for your LLM as context.**Responsible Metrics:**Includes metrics such as bias and toxicity, which determines whether an LLM output contains (generally) harmful and offensive content.**Task-Specific Metrics:**Includes metrics such as summarization, which usually contains a custom criteria depending on the use-case. While most metrics are **generic** and necessarily, they are not sufficient to target specific use-cases. This is why you'll want at least one custom task-specific metric to make your LLM evaluation pipeline production ready (as you'll see later in the G-Eval and DAG sections). For example, if your LLM application is designed to summarize pages of news articles, you\u2019ll need a custom LLM evaluation metric that scores based on: - Whether the summary contains enough information from the original text. - Whether",

    "chunk": "the summary contains any contradictions or hallucinations from the original text. Moreover, if your LLM application has a RAG-based architecture, you\u2019ll probably need to score for the quality of the retrieval context as well. The point is, an LLM evaluation metric assesses an LLM application based on the tasks it was designed to do.* (Note that an LLM application can simply be the LLM itself!)* That brings us to one of the most important points - **your choice of LLM evaluation metrics should cover with both the evaluation criteria of the LLM use case and the LLM system architecture:** **LLM Use Case:**Custom metrics specific to the task, consistent across different implementations.**LLM System Architecture:**Generic metrics (e.g., faithfulness for RAG, task completion for agents) that depend on how the system is built. If you decide to change your LLM system completely tomorrow for the same LLM use case, your custom metrics shouldn't change at all, and vice versa. We'll talk more about the best strategy to choose your metrics later (spoiler: you don't want to have more than 5 metrics), but before that let's go through what makes great metrics great. Great evaluation metrics are: **Quantitative.**Metrics should always compute a score when evaluating the task at hand. This approach enables you to set a minimum passing threshold to determine if your LLM application is \u201cgood enough\u201d and allows you to monitor how these scores change over time as you iterate and improve your implementation.**Reliable.**As unpredictable as LLM outputs can be, the last thing you want is for an LLM evaluation metric to be equally flaky. So, although metrics evaluated using LLMs (aka. LLM-as-a-judge or LLM-Evals), such as G-Eval and especially for DAG, are more accurate than traditional scoring methods, they are often inconsistent, which is where most LLM-Evals fall short.**Accurate.**Reliable scores are meaningless if they don\u2019t truly represent the performance of your LLM application. In fact, the secret to making a good LLM evaluation metric great is to make it align with human expectations as much as possible. So the question becomes, how can LLM evaluation metrics compute reliable and accurate scores? ## Different Ways to Compute Metric Scores In one of my previous articles, I talked about how LLM outputs are notoriously difficult to evaluate. Fortunately, there are numerous established methods available for calculating metric scores \u2014 some utilize neural networks, including embedding models and LLMs, while others are based entirely on statistical analysis. **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} We\u2019ll go through each method and talk about the best approach by the end of this section, so read on to find out! ## Statistical Scorers Before we begin, I want to start by saying statistical scoring methods in my opinion are non-essential to learn about, so feel free to skip straight to the \u201cG-Eval\u201d section if you\u2019re in a rush. This is because statistical methods performs poorly whenever reasoning is required, making it too inaccurate as a scorer for most LLM evaluation criteria. To quickly go through them: - The **BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy)**scorer",

    "chunk": "evaluates the output of your LLM application against annotated ground truths (or, expected outputs). It calculates the precision for each matching n-gram (n consecutive words) between an LLM output and expected output to calculate their geometric mean and applies a brevity penalty if needed. - The **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**scorer is s primarily used for evaluating text summaries from NLP models, and calculates recall by comparing the overlap of n-grams between LLM outputs and expected outputs. It determines the proportion (0\u20131) of n-grams in the reference that are present in the LLM output. - The **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering)**scorer is more comprehensive since it calculates scores by assessing both precision (n-gram matches) and recall (n-gram overlaps), adjusted for word order differences between LLM outputs and expected outputs. It also leverages external linguistic databases like WordNet to account for synonyms. The final score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, with a penalty for ordering discrepancies. **Levenshtein distance**(or edit distance, you probably recognize this as a LeetCode hard DP problem) scorer calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word or text string into another, which can be useful for evaluating spelling corrections, or other tasks where the precise alignment of characters is critical. Since purely statistical scorers hardly not take any semantics into account and have extremely limited reasoning capabilities, they are not accurate enough for evaluating LLM outputs that are often long and complex. However, there are exceptions. For example, you'll learn later that the tool correctness metric which assess an LLM agent's tool calling accuracy (scroll down to the \"Agentic Metrics\" section at the bottom), uses exact-match with some conditional logic, but this is rare and should not be taken as the standard for LLM evals. # Confident AI: The DeepEval LLM Evaluation Platform The leading platform to evaluate and test LLM applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval. **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) # Got Red?

In this section, it is more of the opposite \u2014 scorers that purely rely on NLP models are comparably more accurate, but are also more unreliable due to their probabilistic nature. This shouldn't be a surprise but, scorers that are not LLM-based perform worse than LLM-as-a-judge, also due to the same reason stated for statistical scorers. Non-LLM scorers include: - The **NLI**scorer, which uses Natural Language Inference models (which is a type of NLP classification model) to classify whether an LLM output is",

The score typically ranges between entailment (with a value of 1) and contradiction (with a value of 0), providing a measure of logical coherence. - The **BLEURT (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy with Representations from Transformers)**scorer, which uses pre-trained models like BERT to score LLM outputs on some expected outputs. Apart from inconsistent scores, the reality is there are several shortcomings of these approaches. For example, NLI scorers can also struggle with accuracy when processing long texts, while BLEURT are limited by the quality and representativeness of its training data. So here we go, lets talk about LLM judges instead. #### G-Eval G-Eval is a recently developed framework from a paper titled \u201cNLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment\u201d that **uses LLMs to evaluate LLM outputs (aka. LLM-Evals), and is one the best ways to create task-specific metrics.** **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} G-Eval (docs here) first generates a series of evaluation steps using chain of thoughts (CoTs) before using the generated steps to determine the final score via a form-filling paradigm (this is just a fancy way of saying G-Eval requires several pieces of information to work). For example, evaluating LLM output coherence using G-Eval involves constructing a prompt that contains the criteria and text to be evaluated to generate evaluation steps, before using an LLM to output a score from 1 to 5 based on these steps. Let\u2019s run through the G-Eval algorithm using this example. First, to generate evaluation steps: - Introduce an evaluation task to the LLM of your choice (eg. rate this output from 1\u20135 based on coherence) - Give a definition for your criteria (eg. \u201cCoherence \u2014 the collective quality of all sentences in the actual output\u201d). *(Note that in the original G-Eval paper, the authors only used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for experiments, and having personally played around with different LLMs for G-Eval, I would highly recommend you stick with these models.)* After generating a series of evaluation steps: - Create a prompt by concatenating the evaluation steps with all the arguments listed in your evaluation steps (eg., if you\u2019re looking to evaluate coherence for an LLM output, the LLM output would be a required argument). - At the end of the prompt, ask it to generate a score between 1\u20135, where 5 is better than 1. - (Optional) Take the probabilities of the output tokens from the LLM to normalize the score and take their weighted summation as the final result. Step 3 is optional because to get the probability of the output tokens, you would need access to the raw model embeddings, which is not something guaranteed to be available for all model interfaces. This step however was introduced in the paper because it offers more fine-grained scores and minimizes bias in LLM scoring (as stated in the paper, 3 is known to have a higher token probability for a 1\u20135 scale). Here are the results from the paper, which shows how",

    "chunk": "G-Eval outperforms all traditional, non-LLM evals that were mentioned earlier in this article: **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} G-Eval is great because as an LLM-Eval it is able to take the full semantics of LLM outputs into account, making it much more accurate. And this makes a lot of sense \u2014 think about it, how can non-LLM Evals, which uses scorers that are far less capable than LLMs, possibly understand the full scope of text generated by LLMs? Although G-Eval correlates much more with human judgment when compared to its counterparts, it can still be unreliable, as asking an LLM to come up with a score is indisputably arbitrary. That being said, given how flexible G-Eval\u2019s evaluation criteria can be, I\u2019ve personally implemented G-Eval as a metric for DeepEval, an open-source LLM evaluation framework I\u2019ve been working on (which includes the normalization technique from the original paper). G-Eval is one of the most popular ways to create LLM-as-a-judge metrics as it is simple, easy, and accurate. If you're interested, you can learn everything about G-Eval in full here. #### DAG (Deep Acyclic Graph) G-Eval is great in the case of evaluation where **subjectivity** is involved. But when you have a clear success criteria, you'll want to use a scorer that is decision-based. Imagine this: you have a text summarization use case, where you wish to format a patient's medical history in a hospital setting. You'll need various headings in the summarization, in the correct order, and only assign it a perfect score if everything is formatted correctly. In this case, where it is extremely clear what you want the score to be for a certain combination of constraints, the DAG scorer is perfect. As the name suggests, the DAG (deep acyclic graph) scorer is a decision tree powered by LLM-as-a-judge, where each node is an LLM judgement and each edge is a decision. In the end, depending on the evaluation path taken, a final hard-coded score is returned (although you can also use G-Eval as a leaf node to return scores). By breaking evaluation into fine-grained steps, we achieve deterministically. Another use case for DAG is, to filter away edge cases where your LLM output don't even meet the minimum requirement for evaluation. Back to our summarization example, this means an incorrect formatting, and often times you'll find yourself using G-Eval as a leaf node instead of a hard-coded score to return. You can read more about why DAG works this article here where I talk about LLM-as-a-judge (highly recommended), but here is an example architecture of a DAG for text summarization: **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} And here is the corresponding code in DeepEval (documentation here): The DAG metric is currently the most customizable metric available, and I built it to serve a lot of edge cases that wasn't covered by popular metrics such as answer relevancy, faithfulness, and even custom metrics such as G-Eval.

It is also use case agnostic, similar to G-Eval. Prometheus is a language model using Llama-2-Chat as a base model and fine-tuned on 100K feedback (generated by GPT-4) within the Feedback Collection. Here are the brief results from the prometheus research paper. **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} Prometheus follows the same principles as G-Eval. However, there are several differences: - While G-Eval is a framework that uses GPT-3.5/4, Prometheus is an LLM fine-tuned for evaluation. - While G-Eval generates the score rubric/evaluation steps via CoTs, the score rubric for Prometheus is provided in the prompt instead. - Prometheus requires reference/example evaluation results. Although I personally haven\u2019t tried it, Prometheus is available on hugging face. The reason why I haven\u2019t tried implementing it is because Prometheus was designed to make evaluation open-source instead of depending on proprietary models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPTs. For someone aiming to build the best LLM-Evals available, it wasn\u2019t a good fit. # Confident AI: The DeepEval LLM Evaluation Platform The leading platform to evaluate and test LLM applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval. **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) **Image** [Image download failed: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1].png) # Got Red?

Similar to the previous section, there are non-LLM scorers such as: - The **BERTScore**scorer, which relies on pre-trained language models like BERT and computes the cosine similarity between the contextual embeddings of words in the reference and the generated texts. These similarities are then aggregated to produce a final score. A higher BERTScore indicates a greater degree of semantic overlap between the LLM output and the reference text. - The **MoverScore**scorer, which first uses embedding models, specifically pre-trained language models like BERT to obtain deeply contextualized word embeddings for both the reference text and the generated text before using something called the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) to compute the minimal cost that must be paid to transform the distribution of words in an LLM output to the distribution of words in the reference text. Both the BERTScore and MoverScore scorer is vulnerable to contextual awareness and bias due to their reliance on contextual embeddings from pre-trained models like BERT. But what about LLM-Evals? #### QAG Score QAG (Question Answer Generation) Score is a scorer that leverages LLMs\u2019 high reasoning capabilities to reliably",

It uses confined answers (usually either a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019) to close-ended questions (which can be generated or preset) to compute a final metric score. It is reliable because it does NOT use LLMs to directly generate scores. For example, if you want to compute a score for faithfulness (which measures whether an LLM output was hallucinated or not), you would: - Use an LLM to extract all claims made in an LLM output. - For each claim, ask the ground truth whether it agrees (\u2018yes\u2019) or not (\u2018no\u2019) with the claim made. So for this example LLM output: Martin Luther King Jr., the renowned civil rights leader, was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was in Memphis to support striking sanitation workers and was fatally shot by James Earl Ray, an escaped convict, while standing on the motel\u2019s second-floor balcony. A claim would be: Martin Luther King Jr. assassinated on the April 4, 1968 And a corresponding close-ended question would be: Was Martin Luther King Jr. assassinated on the April 4, 1968? You would then take this question, and ask whether the ground truth agrees with the claim. In the end, you will have a number of \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 answers, which you can use to compute a score via some mathematical formula of your choice. In the case of faithfulness, if we define it as as the proportion of claims in an LLM output that are accurate and consistent with the ground truth, it can easily be calculated by dividing the number of accurate (truthful) claims by the total number of claims made by the LLM. Since we are not using LLMs to directly generate evaluation scores but still leveraging its superior reasoning ability, we get scores that are both accurate and reliable. #### GPTScore Unlike G-Eval which directly performs the evaluation task with a form-filling paradigm, GPTScore uses the conditional probability of generating the target text as an evaluation metric. **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} #### SelfCheckGPT SelfCheckGPT is an odd one. It is a simple sampling-based approach that is used to fact-check LLM outputs. It assumes that hallucinated outputs are not reproducible, whereas if an LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. SelfCheckGPT is an interesting approach because it makes detecting hallucination a reference-less process, which is extremely useful in a production setting. **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} However, although you\u2019ll notice that G-Eval and Prometheus is use case agnostic, SelfCheckGPT is not. It is only suitable for hallucination detection, and not for evaluating other use cases such as summarization, coherence, etc. ## Choosing Your Evaluation Metrics The choice of which LLM evaluation metric to use depends on the use case and architecture of your LLM application. Our experience tells us that you don't want more than 5 LLM evaluation metrics in your evaluation pipeline. As you'll see later,",

But the truth is, when you're evaluating everything, you're evaluating nothing at all. Too much data != good. You'll want: - 1-2 custom metrics (G-Eval or DAG) that are use case specific - 2-3 generic metrics (RAG, agentic, or conversational) that are system specific These are rough numbers and it depends on the complexity of your system. For example, if you\u2019re building a RAG-based customer support chatbot on top of OpenAI\u2019s models with tool calling capabilities, you\u2019ll want 3 RAG metrics (eg., faithfulness, answer relevancy, contextual relevancy) and 1 agentic metric (e.g. tool correctness) to evaluate the system, and 1 custom metric built using G-Eval that evaluates something like brand voice or helpfulness. Here is a nice diagram that summarizes the metrics selection process: **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} Another useful tip of deciding whether to use G-Eval or DAG is, if the criteria is purely subjective, use G-Eval. Otherwise use DAG. I say \"purely\", because you can also use G-Eval as one of the nodes in DAG. In this final section, we\u2019ll be going over the evaluation metrics you absolutely need to know. *(And as a bonus, the implementation of each.)* ## RAG Metrics For those don\u2019t already know what RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is, here is a great read. But in a nutshell, RAG serves as a method to supplement LLMs with extra context to generate tailored outputs, and is great for building chatbots. It is made up of two components \u2014 the retriever, and the generator. **Image** [LLM API error: 404] - {\"error\":\"model \\\"llama3\\\" not found, try pulling it first\"} Here\u2019s how a RAG workflow typically works: - Your RAG system receives an input. - The **retriever**uses this input to perform a vector search in your knowledge base (which nowadays in most cases is a vector database). - The **generator**receives the retrieval context and the user input as additional context to generate a tailor output. Here\u2019s one thing to remember \u2014 **high quality LLM outputs is the product of a great retriever and generator. **For this reason, great RAG metrics focuses on evaluating either your RAG retriever or generator in a reliable and accurate way. (In fact, RAG metrics were originally designed to be reference-less metrics, meaning they don\u2019t require ground truths, making them usable even in a production setting.) **PS. For those looking to unit test RAG systems in CI/CD pipelines, ****click here.** #### Faithfulness Faithfulness is a RAG metric that evaluates whether the LLM/generator in your RAG pipeline is generating LLM outputs that factually aligns with the information presented in the retrieval context. But which scorer should we use for the faithfulness metric? **Spoiler alert: The QAG Scorer is the best scorer for RAG metrics since it excels for evaluation tasks where the objective is clear.** For faithfulness, if you define it as the proportion of truthful claims made in an LLM output with regards to the retrieval",

( *Note that you need to confine the answer to either a \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, or \u2018idk\u2019. The \u2018idk\u2019 state represents the edge case where the retrieval context does not contain relevant information to give a yes/no answer.)* - Add up the total number of truthful claims (\u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018idk\u2019), and divide it by the total number of claims made. This method ensures accuracy by using LLM\u2019s advanced reasoning capabilities while avoiding unreliability in LLM generated scores, making it a better scoring method than G-Eval. If you feel this is too complicated to implement, you can use DeepEval. It\u2019s an open-source package I built and offers all the evaluation metrics you need for LLM evaluation, including the faithfulness metric. DeepEval treats evaluation as test cases.

The key to build a robust answer relevancy metric is to take the retrieval context into account, since additional context may justify a seemingly irrelevant sentence\u2019s relevancy. Here\u2019s an implementation of the answer relevancy metric: *(Remember, we\u2019re using QAG for all RAG metrics)* #### Contextual Precision Contextual Precision is a RAG metric that assesses the quality of your RAG pipeline\u2019s retriever. When we\u2019re talking about contextual metrics, we\u2019re mainly concerned about the relevancy of the retrieval context. A high contextual precision score means nodes that are relevant in the retrieval contextual are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. This is important because LLMs gives more weighting to information in nodes that appear earlier in the retrieval context, which affects the quality of the final output. #### Contextual Recall Contextual Precision is an additional metric for evaluating a",

It is calculated by determining the proportion of sentences in the expected output or ground truth that can be attributed to nodes in the retrieval context. A higher score represents a greater alignment between the retrieved information and the expected output, indicating that the retriever is effectively sourcing relevant and accurate content to aid the generator in producing contextually appropriate responses. #### Contextual Relevancy Probably the simplest metric to understand, contextual relevancy is simply the proportion of sentences in the retrieval context that are relevant to a given input. ## Agentic Metrics If you're new to LLM agent evaluation, check this complete agent evaluation guide that goes in much more depth. Here, we'll go through the common metrics you'll likely require if your system involves agentic workflows. #### Tool Correctness Tool correctness is an agentic metric that assesses the quality of your agentic systems, and is the most unusual metric here because it is based on exact matching and not any LLM-as-a-judge. It is computed by comparing the tools called for a given input to the expected tools that should be called: In this example, the tools are \"WebSearch\" and \"ToolQuery\". You can find the docs for this metric here. #### Task Completion Task completion is an agentic metric that uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate whether your LLM agent is able to accomplish its given task. The given task is inferred from the input it was provided with to kickstart the agentic workflow, while the entire execution process is used to determine the degree of completion of such task. Full documentation for more comprehensive examples available on DeepEval's docs. ## Fine-Tuning Metrics When I say \u201cfine-tuning metrics\u201d, what I really mean is metrics that assess the LLM itself, rather than the entire system. Putting aside cost and performance benefits, LLMs are often fine-tuned to either: - Incorporate additional contextual knowledge. - Adjust its behavior. If you're looking to fine-tune your own models, here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to fine-tune LLaMA-2 in under 2 hours, all within Google Colab, with evaluations. #### Hallucination Some of you might recognize this being the same as the faithfulness metric. Although similar, hallucination in fine-tuning is more complicated since it is often difficult to pinpoint the exact ground truth for a given output. To go around this problem, we can take advantage of SelfCheckGPT\u2019s zero-shot approach to sample the proportion of hallucinated sentences in an LLM output. However, this approach can get very expensive, so for now I would suggest using an NLI scorer and manually provide some context as the ground truth instead. #### Toxicity The toxicity metric evaluates the extent to which a text contains offensive, harmful, or inappropriate language. Off-the-shelf pre-trained models like Detoxify, which utilize the BERT scorer, can be employed to score toxicity. However, this method can be inaccurate since words \u201cassociated with swearing, insults or profanity are present in a comment, is likely to be classified as toxic, regardless of the tone or the intent of the author e.g. humorous/self-deprecating\u201d. In this case, you might want to",

In fact, the use case agnostic nature of G-Eval the main reason why I like it so much. #### Bias The bias metric evaluates aspects such as political, gender, and social biases in textual content. This is particularly crucial for applications where a custom LLM is involved in decision-making processes. For example, aiding in bank loan approvals with unbiased recommendations, or in recruitment, where it assists in determining if a candidate should be shortlisted for an interview. Similar to toxicity, bias can be evaluated using G-Eval. (But don\u2019t get me wrong, QAG can also be a viable scorer for metrics like toxicity and bias.) Bias is a highly subjective matter, varying significantly across different geographical, geopolitical, and geosocial environments. For example, language or expressions considered neutral in one culture may carry different connotations in another. *(This is also why few-shot evaluation doesn\u2019t work well for bias.)* A potential solution would be to fine-tune a custom LLM for evaluation or provide extremely clear rubrics for in-context learning, and for this reason, I believe bias is the hardest metric of all to implement. ## Use Case Specific Metrics #### Helpfulness A custom helpfulness metric assesses whether your LLM app is able to be of use to users interacting with it. When a criteria is so subjective, it. is best to use G-Eval: Full example on G-Eval implementation here. #### Prompt Alignment The prompt alignment metric assesses whether your LLM is able to generate text according to the instructions laid out in your prompt template. The algorithm is simple yet effective, we first: - Loop through all instructions found in your prompt template, before... - Determining whether each instruction is followed based on the input and output This works because instead of supplying the entire prompt to the metric, we only supply the list of instructions, which means your judge LLM instead of having to take in the entire prompt as context (which can be lengthy and cause hallucinations), it just has to consider one instruction at a time when making a verdict on whether an instruction is followed. Documentation on this metric can be found here. #### Summarization I actually covered the summarization metric in depth in one of my previous articles, so I would highly recommend to give it a good read (and I promise its much shorter than this article). In summary (no pun intended), all good summaries: - Is factually aligned with the original text. - Includes important information from the original text. Using QAG, we can calculate both factual alignment and inclusion scores to compute a final summarization score. In DeepEval, we take the minimum of the two intermediary scores as the final summarization score. Admittedly, I haven\u2019t done the summarization metric enough justice because I don\u2019t want to make this article longer than it already is. But for those interested, I would highly recommend reading this article to learn more about building your own summarization metric using QAG. ## Conclusion Congratulations for making to the end!

    "chunk": "been a long list of scorers and metrics, and I hope you now know all the different factors you need to consider and choices you have to make when picking a metric for LLM evaluation. The main objective of an LLM evaluation metric is to quantify the performance of your LLM (application), and to do this we have different scorers, with some better than others. For LLM evaluation, scorers that uses LLMs (G-Eval, Prometheus, SelfCheckGPT, and QAG) are most accurate due to their high reasoning capabilities, but we need to take extra pre-cautions to ensure these scores are reliable. At the end of the day, the choice of metrics depend on your use case and implementation of your LLM application, where RAG and fine-tuning metrics are a great starting point to evaluating LLM outputs. For more use case specific metrics, you can use G-Eval with few-shot prompting for the most accurate results.
